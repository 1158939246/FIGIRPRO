Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Write all comments made on the post titled 'How does gentle boosting differ from AdaBoost?'\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve comments associated with a specific post title. This requires joining the `posts` table to find the post ID based on the title and then joining the `comments` table to get the comments related to that post.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Title` = 'How does gentle boosting differ from AdaBoost?'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the post with the specified title.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `Title` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Title` = 'How does gentle boosting differ from AdaBoost?'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (post title):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Title` = 'How does gentle boosting differ from AdaBoost?'\n\n* **Main Question (comments):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Title` = 'How does gentle boosting differ from AdaBoost?'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `comments` and `posts` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
