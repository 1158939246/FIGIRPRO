Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List down at least five full names of superheroes with blue eyes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the full names of superheroes who have blue eyes. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `colour` table to filter by eye color.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <blue eyes> LIMIT 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** blue eyes\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `colour` table where we check for the color 'Blue'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (blue eyes):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue'\n\n* **Main Question (full names of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue' LIMIT 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `LIMIT 5` ensures we only retrieve five results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
