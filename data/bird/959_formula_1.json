Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year is 2009):**  \n    * **SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2009)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (time is in champion format):**  \n    * **SQL:** `time` NOT LIKE '+%'\n\n* **Main Question (fastest lap number of the champion):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `fastestLap` FROM `results` WHERE `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2009) AND `time` NOT LIKE '+%'\n\n**3.
