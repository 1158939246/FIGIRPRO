Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all patients with triglyceride (TG) level beyond the normal range, how many are age more than 50 years?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who have a TG level of 200 or more and are older than 50 years. This involves filtering based on the TG level and calculating the age from the `Birthday` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <TG level condition> AND <age condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** TG level condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table where we select rows with a TG level of 200 or more.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`TG` >= 200\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the age based on the `Birthday` column. The condition for age being more than 50 years can be expressed using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the current date and the `Birthday` date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`)) > 50\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (TG level condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`TG` >= 200\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age condition):**\n    * **SQL:** (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`)) > 50\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`TG` >= 200 AND (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`)) > 50\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
