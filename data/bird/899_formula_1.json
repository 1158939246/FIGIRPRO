Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List circuits which host 4 F1 races from year 1990 to 2000.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find circuits that have hosted at least 4 races within the specified year range. This requires counting the number of races for each circuit and filtering based on the year.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `circuitId` FROM `races` WHERE <year between 1990 and 2000> GROUP BY `circuitId` HAVING COUNT(`raceId`) = 4\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** year between 1990 and 2000\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied directly to the `races` table using the `year` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `year` BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year between 1990 and 2000):**\n    * **SQL:** `year` BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000\n\n* **Main Question (count of races per circuit):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `circuitId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000 GROUP BY `circuitId` HAVING COUNT(`raceId`) = 4\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `GROUP BY` to aggregate the results by `circuitId` and `HAVING` to filter for circuits that hosted exactly 4 races.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
