This requires joining the `transactions_1k`, `gasstations`, and `products` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Description` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` INNER JOIN `products` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`ProductID` = `T3`.`ProductID` WHERE <Country is CZE>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Country is CZE\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `gasstations` table using the `Country` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
