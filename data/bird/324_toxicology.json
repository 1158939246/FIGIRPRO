This involves counting the total number of bonds and counting how many of those are single bonds. We will use the `bond` table for this calculation.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(<single bond count>) / COUNT(<total bond count>)) * 100 AS percentage FROM bond\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** single bond count\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of bonds that are of type single, which is represented by `bond_type = '-'`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN bond_type = '-' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** total bond count\n        * **Analysis:** This is simply counting all the bonds in the `bond` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(bond_id)\n\n**2.
