Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter by full name):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`full_name` = 'Karen Beecher-Duncan'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (join to get eye colour):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id`\n\n* **Main Question (retrieve eye colour):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Karen Beecher-Duncan'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
