Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which of the three segments\u2014SME, LAM and KAM\u2014has the biggest and lowest percentage increases in consumption paid in EUR between 2012 and 2013?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage increase in consumption for each segment between the years 2012 and 2013. This requires filtering the `yearmonth` table for the relevant years, joining with the `customers` table to get the segments, and then calculating the percentage increase.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT Segment, \n           (SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2013' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END) - \n            SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2012' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END)) / \n           SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2013' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS PercentageIncrease\n    FROM yearmonth AS Y\n    INNER JOIN customers AS C ON Y.CustomerID = C.CustomerID\n    WHERE C.Segment IN ('SME', 'LAM', 'KAM')\n    GROUP BY Segment\n    ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate consumption for 2013\n        * **Analysis:** We need to sum the consumption for the year 2013.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2013' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END)\n        ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Calculate consumption for 2012\n        * **Analysis:** We need to sum the consumption for the year 2012.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2012' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END)\n        ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Calculate percentage increase\n        * **Analysis:** This is already included in the main question's pseudo SQL, but it involves the formula for percentage increase.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        (Increase or Decrease / consumption for 2013) * 100\n        ```\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (consumption for 2013):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2013' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END)\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (consumption for 2012):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2012' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END)\n    ```\n\n* **Main Question (percentage increase):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT Segment, \n           (SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2013' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END) - \n            SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2012' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END)) / \n           SUM(CASE WHEN STRFTIME('%Y', Date) = '2013' THEN Consumption ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS PercentageIncrease\n    FROM yearmonth AS Y\n    INNER JOIN customers AS C ON Y.CustomerID = C.CustomerID\n    WHERE C.Segment IN ('SME', 'LAM', 'KAM')\n    GROUP BY Segment\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause allows us to calculate the percentage increase for each segment.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
