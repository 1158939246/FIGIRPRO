Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the full names of all the superheroes with over 15 super powers.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of superpowers associated with each superhero and filter those with a count greater than 15. The `superhero` table contains the `full_name`, and the `hero_power` table links superheroes to their powers.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` GROUP BY `T1`.`full_name` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`power_id`) > 15\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of superpowers for each superhero\n        * **Analysis:** This is achieved by grouping the results by superhero's full name and counting the number of associated powers.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`power_id`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of superpowers):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`power_id`)\n\n* **Main Question (full names of superheroes with over 15 superpowers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` GROUP BY `T1`.`full_name` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`power_id`) > 15\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause effectively filters the results based on the count of superpowers.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
