Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State the ID and age of patient with positive degree of coagulation.  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` from the `Patient` table and calculate the `age` based on the `Birthday` column. We will filter the results based on the `RVVT` column from the `Examination` table, which indicates a positive degree of coagulation.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(`T1`.`Birthday`)) AS `age` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <positive degree of coagulation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** positive degree of coagulation  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table using the `RVVT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RVVT` = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (positive degree of coagulation):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RVVT` = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (ID and age of patient):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(`T1`.`Birthday`)) AS `age` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`RVVT` = '+'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
