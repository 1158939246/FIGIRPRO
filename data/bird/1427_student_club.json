Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the budget category of the events located at MU 215 and a guest speaker type with a 0 budget spent? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `category` from the `budget` table, but we must first filter the events based on their `location`, `type`, and the budget spent. This requires joining the `event`, `budget`, and `attendance` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`category` FROM `budget` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T1`.`event_id` WHERE <events located at MU 215> AND <type is Guest Speaker> AND <spent is 0>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** events located at MU 215\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `location` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`location` = 'MU 215'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** type is Guest Speaker\n        * **Analysis:** This is another filter on the `event` table using the `type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'Guest Speaker'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** spent is 0\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `budget` table using the `spent` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`spent` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (events located at MU 215):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`location` = 'MU 215'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (type is Guest Speaker):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'Guest Speaker'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (spent is 0):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`spent` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (budget category):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`category` FROM `budget` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T1`.`event_id` WHERE `T1`.`location` = 'MU 215' AND `T1`.`type` = 'Guest Speaker' AND `T2`.`spent` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
