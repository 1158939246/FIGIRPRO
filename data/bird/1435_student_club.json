Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the names of closed event as \"game\" that was closed from 3/15/2019 to 3/20/2020. \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `event_name` from the `event` table where the event type is 'Game', the status is 'Closed', and the event date falls within the specified range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `event_name` FROM `event` WHERE <event is a game> AND <event is closed> AND <event date is within the specified range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event is a game\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `type` = 'Game'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** event is closed\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `status` = 'Closed'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** event date is within the specified range\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `event_date` column using the `BETWEEN` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `event_date` BETWEEN '2019-03-15' AND '2020-03-20'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (event is a game):**\n    * **SQL:** `type` = 'Game'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (event is closed):**\n    * **SQL:** `status` = 'Closed'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (event date is within the specified range):**\n    * **SQL:** `event_date` BETWEEN '2019-03-15' AND '2020-03-20'\n\n* **Main Question (names of closed game events):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `event_name` FROM `event` WHERE `type` = 'Game' AND `status` = 'Closed' AND `event_date` BETWEEN '2019-03-15' AND '2020-03-20'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `event` table based on the required conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
