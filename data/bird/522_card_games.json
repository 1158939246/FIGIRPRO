Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which cards are ranked 1st on EDHRec? List all of the cards name and its banned play format.  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the card names and their corresponding banned play formats for cards that have an `edhrecRank` of 1 and a `status` of 'Banned'. This requires joining the `cards` and `legalities` tables based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`format` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <ranked 1st> AND <banned status>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** ranked 1st\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `edhrecRank` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`edhrecRank` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** banned status\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `legalities` table using the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'Banned'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (ranked 1st):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`edhrecRank` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (banned status):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'Banned'\n\n* **Main Question (cards name and banned play format):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`format` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`edhrecRank` = 1 AND `T2`.`status` = 'Banned'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
