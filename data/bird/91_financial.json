The relevant columns are `A12` for 1995 and `A13` for 1996 from the `district` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(A12) AS avg_1995, AVG(A13) AS avg_1996 FROM district\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Calculate average unemployment rate for 1995\n    * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we will use the `AVG()` function on the `A12` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** AVG(A12)\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Calculate average unemployment rate for 1996\n    * **Analysis:** Similarly, we will use the `AVG()` function on the `A13` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** AVG(A13)\n\n**2.
