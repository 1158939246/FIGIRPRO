We will use the `COUNT()` function to get the total number of such cards.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <power is infinite>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** power is infinite\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table where we select rows with `power` equal to '*'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `power` = '*'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (power is infinite):**\n    * **SQL:** `power` = '*'\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards with infinite power):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE `power` = '*'\n\n**3.

It directly counts the number of cards with infinite power without any unnecessary joins or subqueries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
