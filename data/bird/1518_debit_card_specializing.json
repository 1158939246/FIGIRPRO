This requires joining the `transactions_1k` table with the `gasstations` table to get the country information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Country` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE <date condition> AND <time condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** date condition  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the transactions based on the date '2012-08-24'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-24'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** time condition  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the transactions based on the time '12:42:00'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Time` = '12:42:00'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
