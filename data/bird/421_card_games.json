Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list top three unknown power cards that have promotional types for arena league in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select cards with unknown power and promotional types for arena league. The `power` column in the `cards` table indicates unknown power, and the `promoTypes` column indicates promotional types. We will filter based on these criteria and order the results alphabetically by the card name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE <unknown power> AND <promotional types for arena league> ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** unknown power\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be expressed as checking if the `power` column is NULL or equals '*'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `power` IS NULL OR `power` = '*'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** promotional types for arena league\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be expressed by checking if the `promoTypes` column contains 'arenaleague'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `promoTypes` = 'arenaleague'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (unknown power):**\n    * **SQL:** `power` IS NULL OR `power` = '*'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (promotional types for arena league):**\n    * **SQL:** `promoTypes` = 'arenaleague'\n\n* **Main Question (top three unknown power cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `power` IS NULL OR `power` = '*' AND `promoTypes` = 'arenaleague' ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a straightforward `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the conditions for unknown power and promotional types, followed by an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results alphabetically.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
