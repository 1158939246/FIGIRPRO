Provide the ID and sex.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter patients diagnosed with SLE and check for normal hemoglobin levels. The oldest patient will be determined by the earliest birthday value. We will select the `ID` and `SEX` columns from the `Patient` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ID`, `SEX` FROM `Patient` WHERE <diagnosed with SLE> AND <normal hemoglobin level> ORDER BY <birthday> ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** diagnosed with SLE\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Diagnosis` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal hemoglobin level\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `Patient` table with the `Laboratory` table to check the `HGB` values. The normal range for hemoglobin is between 10 and 17.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `HGB` > 10 AND `HGB` < 17\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (diagnosed with SLE):**\n    * **SQL:** `Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal hemoglobin level):**\n    * **SQL:** `HGB` > 10 AND `HGB` < 17\n\n* **Main Question (oldest patient with normal hemoglobin):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE' AND `T2`.`HGB` > 10 AND `T2`.`HGB` < 17 ORDER BY `T1`.`Birthday` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
