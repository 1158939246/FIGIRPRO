Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many female patients who came at the hospital in 1997 was immediately followed at the outpatient clinic? \n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count female patients who meet two criteria: they were admitted in 1997 and were followed at the outpatient clinic. This involves filtering the `Patient` table based on the `SEX`, `Description`, and `Admission` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` WHERE <female patients> AND <came in 1997> AND <followed at outpatient clinic>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SEX` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** came at the hospital in 1997\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Description` column to check if the year is 1997. We can use the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year from the date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `Description`) = '1997'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** followed at the outpatient clinic\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `Admission` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Admission` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (came at the hospital in 1997):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `Description`) = '1997'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (followed at outpatient clinic):**\n    * **SQL:** `Admission` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (count of female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` WHERE `SEX` = 'F' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `Description`) = '1997' AND `Admission` = '-'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `Patient` table based on the required conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
