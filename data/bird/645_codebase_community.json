We will use the `comments` table to filter by `UserId` and `Score`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `comments` WHERE <negative comments> AND <given by user ID 13>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** negative comments  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Score` column in the `comments` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Score` < 60\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** given by user ID 13  \n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `UserId` column in the `comments` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `UserId` = 13\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (negative comments):**  \n    * **SQL:** `Score` < 60\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (given by user ID 13):**  \n    * **SQL:** `UserId` = 13\n\n* **Main Question (count of negative comments by user ID 13):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `comments` WHERE `Score` < 60 AND `UserId` = 13\n\n**3.
