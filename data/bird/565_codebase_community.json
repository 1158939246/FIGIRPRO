Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** User No.23853 gave a comment to a post at 9:08:18 on 2013/7/12, was that post well-finished?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to check if the post associated with the comment made by User No. 23853 is well-finished. A post is considered well-finished if its `ClosedDate` is not NULL. We will need to join the `comments` table with the `posts` table to check the `ClosedDate`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT <well-finished condition> FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`UserId` = 23853 AND `T1`.`CreationDate` = '2013-07-12 09:08:18.0'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** well-finished condition\n        * **Analysis:** A post is well-finished if `ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (well-finished condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (check if post is well-finished):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`UserId` = 23853 AND `T1`.`CreationDate` = '2013-07-12 09:08:18.0'\n\n**3.
