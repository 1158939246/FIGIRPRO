Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the superheroes with the super power of \"Super Strength\", how many of them have a height of over 200cm? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the superheroes who have the superpower \"Super Strength\" and a height greater than 200 cm. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table to filter by superpower and then applying the height condition.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` WHERE <super power is Super Strength> AND <height is over 200cm>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** super power is Super Strength\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter the results based on the `power_name` in the `superpower` table. We need to join the `hero_power` table with the `superpower` table to get the corresponding power name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`power_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `superpower` WHERE `power_name` = 'Super Strength')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** height is over 200cm\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter the results based on the `height_cm` column in the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` > 200\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (super power is Super Strength):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`power_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `superpower` WHERE `power_name` = 'Super Strength')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (height is over 200cm):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` > 200\n\n* **Main Question (count of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` WHERE `T2`.`power_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `superpower` WHERE `power_name` = 'Super Strength') AND `T1`.`height_cm` > 200\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
