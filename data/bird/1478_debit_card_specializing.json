This requires aggregating the consumption data by segment and then identifying the segment with the minimum total consumption.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Segment`, SUM(`Consumption`) AS `TotalConsumption` FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` GROUP BY `Segment` ORDER BY `TotalConsumption` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate total consumption by segment\n        * **Analysis:** We will sum the `Consumption` for each segment by joining the `yearmonth` table with the `customers` table on `CustomerID`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Segment`, SUM(`Consumption`) AS `TotalConsumption` FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` GROUP BY `Segment`\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and aggregating the consumption data correctly. The final query is straightforward and adheres to the requirements.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
