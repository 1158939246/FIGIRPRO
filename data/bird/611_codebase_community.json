Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Mention the reputation of users who had obtained the badge on 7/19/2010 7:39:08 PM.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the reputation of users who obtained a badge at a specific date. This requires joining the `badges` table with the `users` table to access the `Reputation` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Reputation` FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <badge obtained at specific date>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** badge obtained at specific date\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `badges` table for entries where the `Date` matches '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (badge obtained at specific date):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n* **Main Question (reputation of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Reputation` FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `badges` and `users` tables based on the user ID, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
