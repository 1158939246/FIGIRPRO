This requires joining the `cards` table with the `sets` table based on the `setCode`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT <result> FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE <card name is 'Angel of Mercy'> AND <mtgoCode is NOT NULL>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** card name is 'Angel of Mercy'  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Angel of Mercy'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** mtgoCode is NOT NULL  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `sets` table to ensure that the `mtgoCode` column is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`mtgoCode` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (card name is 'Angel of Mercy'):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Angel of Mercy'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (mtgoCode is NOT NULL):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`mtgoCode` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (check if the card appears on Magic: The Gathering Online):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T1`.`name` = 'Angel of Mercy' AND `T2`.`mtgoCode` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 can be simplified to directly return a boolean result indicating whether the card appears on Magic: The Gathering Online.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
