                "plan": "**Question**: What is the total amount of Community College District closure in 1989 in the city of San Francisco?  \n**Evidence**: The question refers to the closure of Community College Districts, which can be identified by the `StatusType` column in the `schools` table. The year of closure can be derived from the `ClosedDate` column, and the city is specified in the `MailCity` column.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the total amount of Community College District closure in 1989 in the city of San Francisco?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to sum the number of closures for Community College Districts in San Francisco for the year 1989. This involves filtering the `schools` table for the relevant `StatusType`, `ClosedDate`, and `MailCity`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE <closure in 1989> AND <city is San Francisco> AND <district type is Community College District>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** closure in 1989\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `ClosedDate` column to check if the year is 1989.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `ClosedDate`) = '1989'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** city is San Francisco\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `MailCity` column to check if it is 'San Francisco'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `MailCity` = 'San Francisco'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** district type is Community College District\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `DOCType` column to check if it is 'Community College District'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `DOCType` = 'Community College District'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (closure in 1989):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `ClosedDate`) = '1989'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (city is San Francisco):**\n    * **SQL:** `MailCity` = 'San Francisco'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (district type is Community College District):**\n    * **SQL:** `DOCType` = 'Community College District'\n\n* **Main Question (total amount of closures):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `ClosedDate`) = '1989' AND `MailCity` = 'San Francisco' AND `DOCType` = 'Community College District'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It uses a single `SELECT` statement with multiple `WHERE` conditions to filter the necessary records.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
