Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many cards with print rarity have ruling text printed on 01/02/2007? \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of cards that meet two criteria: they have a rarity of 'rare' and there is a ruling text associated with them that was printed on the specified date. We will need to join the `cards` and `rulings` tables based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <rarity is rare> AND <ruling date is 01/02/2007>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** rarity is rare\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `rarity` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`rarity` = 'rare'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ruling date is 01/02/2007\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `rulings` table using the `date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date` = '2007-02-01'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (rarity is rare):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`rarity` = 'rare'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ruling date is 01/02/2007):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`date` = '2007-02-01'\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`rarity` = 'rare' AND `T2`.`date` = '2007-02-01'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
