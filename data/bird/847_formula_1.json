This requires filtering the `qualifying` table for `raceId = 19` and then finding the driver associated with the minimum `q2` time.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `surname` FROM `drivers` WHERE `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `qualifying` WHERE `raceId` = 19 ORDER BY `q2` ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the driverId with the best lap time in race number 19.\n        * **Analysis:** This involves selecting the `driverId` from the `qualifying` table where `raceId` is 19 and ordering by `q2` to get the minimum time.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `qualifying` WHERE `raceId` = 19 ORDER BY `q2` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (driverId with the best lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `qualifying` WHERE `raceId` = 19 ORDER BY `q2` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Main Question (surname of the driver):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `surname` FROM `drivers` WHERE `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `qualifying` WHERE `raceId` = 19 ORDER BY `q2` ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query is already efficient, using a subquery to find the `driverId` with the best `q2` time and then using that to find the corresponding surname in the `drivers` table.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
