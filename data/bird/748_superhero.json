Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the eye colour of superhero with superhero ID 75?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the eye colour of a specific superhero identified by their ID. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `colour` table based on the `eye_colour_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`id` = 75\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Join superhero and colour tables\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we need to join the two tables on the `eye_colour_id` and `id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by superhero ID\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to only include the superhero with ID 75.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`id` = 75\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (join superhero and colour):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (filter by superhero ID):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`id` = 75\n\n* **Main Question (eye colour):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`id` = 75\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
