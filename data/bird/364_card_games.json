To do this, we first need to find the `uuid` of the card \"Cloudchaser Eagle\" from the `cards` table. Then, we can use this `uuid` to get the corresponding `status` from the `legalities` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`status` FROM `legalities` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`uuid` = (SELECT `T2`.`uuid` FROM `cards` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Cloudchaser Eagle')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the uuid of the card \"Cloudchaser Eagle\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to filter the `cards` table by the card name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Cloudchaser Eagle'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (uuid of the card):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`uuid` FROM `cards` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Cloudchaser Eagle'\n\n* **Main Question (status of the card):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`status` FROM `legalities` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`uuid` = (SELECT `T2`.`uuid` FROM `cards` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Cloudchaser Eagle')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query is already efficient as it uses a subquery to find the `uuid` of the card and then retrieves the `status` from the `legalities` table based on that `uuid`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
