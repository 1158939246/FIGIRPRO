Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the driver who had the Q2 time as 0:01:40 in the qualifying race No. 355, what is his nationality?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the nationality of a driver based on their qualifying time in a specific race. The `qualifying` table contains the qualifying times and references the `drivers` table to get the driver's nationality.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`nationality` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <Q2 time is 0:01:40> AND <raceId is 355>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Q2 time is 0:01:40\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `qualifying` table using the `q2` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`q2` = '0:01:40'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** raceId is 355\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `qualifying` table using the `raceId` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 355\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Q2 time is 0:01:40):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`q2` = '0:01:40'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (raceId is 355):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 355\n\n* **Main Question (nationality of the driver):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`nationality` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`q2` = '0:01:40' AND `T1`.`raceId` = 355\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `qualifying` and `drivers` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
