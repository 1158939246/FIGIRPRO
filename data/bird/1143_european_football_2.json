However, we need to filter the matches to only include those that belong to the Netherlands Eredivisie league. This requires a join between the `Match` table and the `League` table to filter by league name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`home_team_goal`) FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Netherlands Eredivisie'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Match` and `League` tables based on the league ID, and we are filtering for the specific league name. There are no unnecessary columns or nested queries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
