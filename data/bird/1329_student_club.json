Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What county did Sherri Ramsey grow up?\n    * **Analysis:** To answer this question, we need to find the county associated with the member named Sherri Ramsey. The relevant information is stored in the `member` table (for the member's name) and the `zip_code` table (for the county). We will join these two tables based on the `zip` code.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`county` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sherri' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Ramsey'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the member Sherri Ramsey\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `member` table for the specific first and last name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sherri' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Ramsey'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify the member):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sherri' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Ramsey'\n\n* **Main Question (county of Sherri Ramsey):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`county` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sherri' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Ramsey'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `zip_code` tables based on the `zip` code, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
