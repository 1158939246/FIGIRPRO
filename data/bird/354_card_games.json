We will need to filter the `cards` table by the `artist` column and then count the distinct values in the `type` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `type`) FROM `cards` WHERE <artist is Aaron Boyd>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** artist is Aaron Boyd  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `artist` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `artist` = 'Aaron Boyd'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (artist is Aaron Boyd):**  \n    * **SQL:** `artist` = 'Aaron Boyd'\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct card types):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `type`) FROM `cards` WHERE `artist` = 'Aaron Boyd'\n\n**3.
