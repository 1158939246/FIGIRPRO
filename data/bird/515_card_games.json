Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the minimum release date of mythic cards and their corresponding legal play formats. This requires joining the `cards`, `legalities`, and possibly filtering by rarity.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MIN(`originalReleaseDate`), `T2`.`format` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <mythic card> AND <legal play format> GROUP BY `T2`.`format`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** mythic card\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `rarity` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`rarity` = 'mythic'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** legal play format\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `legalities` table for entries where the `status` is 'legal'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'legal'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (mythic card):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`rarity` = 'mythic'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (legal play format):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'legal'\n\n* **Main Question (oldest mythic card release date and legal formats):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MIN(`T1`.`originalReleaseDate`), `T2`.`format` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`rarity` = 'mythic' AND `T2`.`status` = 'legal' GROUP BY `T2`.`format`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we get distinct legal formats for the mythic cards.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
