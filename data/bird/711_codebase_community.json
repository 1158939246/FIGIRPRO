This requires filtering the `comments` table for comments with a score of 0 and then joining it with the `users` table to filter by age.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <comments score is 0> AND <user age is 40>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** comments score is 0\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `comments` table using the `Score` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Score` = 0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** user age is 40\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `users` table based on the `Age` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Age` = 40\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
