This requires a simple filter on the `comments` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Text` FROM `comments` WHERE <score = 17>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** score = 17\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `Score` column in the `comments` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Score` = 17\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (score = 17):**\n    * **SQL:** `Score` = 17\n\n* **Main Question (contents of comments):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `Text` FROM `comments` WHERE `Score` = 17\n\n**3.
