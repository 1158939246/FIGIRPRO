Please give the name and year.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the race with the minimum finishing time, which is represented by the `milliseconds` column in the `results` table. To get the race name and year, we will need to join the `results` table with the `races` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, `T2`.`year` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`milliseconds` = (SELECT MIN(`milliseconds`) FROM `results` WHERE `milliseconds` IS NOT NULL)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Minimum finishing time\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation to find the minimum value of the `milliseconds` column in the `results` table, ensuring we exclude NULL values.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MIN(`milliseconds`) FROM `results` WHERE `milliseconds` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (minimum finishing time):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT MIN(`milliseconds`) FROM `results` WHERE `milliseconds` IS NOT NULL)\n\n* **Main Question (race name and year):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, `T2`.`year` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`milliseconds` = (SELECT MIN(`milliseconds`) FROM `results` WHERE `milliseconds` IS NOT NULL)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `results` and `races` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the minimum finishing time.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
