Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average of fastest lap speed in the 2009 Spanish Grand Prix race?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of the `fastestLapSpeed` for the race named 'Spanish Grand Prix' that took place in 2009. This requires joining the `races` table with the `results` table to access the `fastestLapSpeed` data.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE <race is Spanish Grand Prix> AND <year is 2009>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race is Spanish Grand Prix  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `races` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Spanish Grand Prix'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** year is 2009  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied directly to the `races` table using the `year` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`year` = 2009\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race is Spanish Grand Prix):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Spanish Grand Prix'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (year is 2009):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`year` = 2009\n\n* **Main Question (average of fastest lap speed):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`name` = 'Spanish Grand Prix' AND `T1`.`year` = 2009\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
