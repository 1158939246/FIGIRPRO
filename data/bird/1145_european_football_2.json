Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which top 4 leagues had the most games in the 2015-2016 season?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of games for each league in the specified season and then select the top 4 leagues based on that count. This requires joining the `Match` table with the `League` table to associate games with their respective leagues.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <season = '2015/2016'> GROUP BY `T2`.`name` ORDER BY COUNT(`T1`.`id`) DESC LIMIT 4\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** season = '2015/2016'  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter applied to the `Match` table using the `season` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (season filter):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n* **Main Question (top 4 leagues):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016' GROUP BY `T2`.`name` ORDER BY COUNT(`T1`.`id`) DESC LIMIT 4\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Match` and `League` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to get the top 4 leagues.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
