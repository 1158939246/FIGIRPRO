Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which are the top five best selling products? \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for the top five products based on sales. To determine the best-selling products, we need to aggregate the sales data from the `transactions_1k` table, grouping by `ProductID` and summing the `Amount` sold. We will then join this with the `products` table to get the full names of the products.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Description` FROM `products` AS `T2` INNER JOIN (SELECT `ProductID`, SUM(`Amount`) AS `TotalSales` FROM `transactions_1k` GROUP BY `ProductID` ORDER BY `TotalSales` DESC LIMIT 5) AS `T1` ON `T1`.`ProductID` = `T2`.`ProductID`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate total sales for each product\n        * **Analysis:** We need to sum the `Amount` for each `ProductID` in the `transactions_1k` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ProductID`, SUM(`Amount`) AS `TotalSales` FROM `transactions_1k` GROUP BY `ProductID` ORDER BY `TotalSales` DESC LIMIT 5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total sales for each product):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `ProductID`, SUM(`Amount`) AS `TotalSales` FROM `transactions_1k` GROUP BY `ProductID` ORDER BY `TotalSales` DESC LIMIT 5\n\n* **Main Question (top five best selling products):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Description` FROM `products` AS `T2` INNER JOIN (SELECT `ProductID`, SUM(`Amount`) AS `TotalSales` FROM `transactions_1k` GROUP BY `ProductID` ORDER BY `TotalSales` DESC LIMIT 5) AS `T1` ON `T1`.`ProductID` = `T2`.`ProductID`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the aggregated sales data with the product descriptions, ensuring we only retrieve the top five products based on sales.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
