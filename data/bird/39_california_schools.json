Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average number of test takers from Fresno schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of `NumTstTakr` from the `satscores` table for schools that opened in 1980. We will filter the results based on the `OpenDate` in the `schools` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`NumTstTakr`) FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <schools opened in 1980> AND <schools in Fresno>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** schools opened in 1980\n        * **Analysis:** We will filter the `OpenDate` column in the `schools` table to include only those schools that opened in the year 1980.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `OpenDate`) = '1980'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** schools in Fresno\n        * **Analysis:** We will filter the `City` column in the `schools` table to include only those schools located in Fresno.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`City` = 'Fresno'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (schools opened in 1980):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `OpenDate`) = '1980'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (schools in Fresno):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`City` = 'Fresno'\n\n* **Main Question (average number of test takers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`NumTstTakr`) FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`OpenDate`) = '1980' AND `T2`.`City` = 'Fresno'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
