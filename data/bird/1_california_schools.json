Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate the eligible free rates and filter for continuation schools. We will need to compute the ratio of `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` to `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` and then order the results to find the lowest three rates.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS eligible_free_rate FROM `frpm` WHERE <condition for continuation schools> ORDER BY eligible_free_rate ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** condition for continuation schools\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `frpm` table to include only those records where the `Educational Option Type` is 'Continuation School'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Educational Option Type` = 'Continuation School'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (condition for continuation schools):**\n    * **SQL:** `Educational Option Type` = 'Continuation School'\n\n* **Main Question (eligible free rates):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS eligible_free_rate FROM `frpm` WHERE `Educational Option Type` = 'Continuation School' ORDER BY eligible_free_rate ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
