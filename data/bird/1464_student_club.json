Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Write the full names of students who received funds on the date of 9/9/2019 and include the amount received.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `amount` for members who received funds on a specific date. This requires joining the `member` and `income` tables based on the `link_to_member` foreign key.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`amount` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE <received funds on 9/9/2019>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** received funds on 9/9/2019\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `income` table using the `date_received` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date_received` = '2019-09-09'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (received funds on 9/9/2019):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`date_received` = '2019-09-09'\n\n* **Main Question (full names and amount):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`amount` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE `T2`.`date_received` = '2019-09-09'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `income` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
