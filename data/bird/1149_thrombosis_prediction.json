If we denote the count of male in-patients as `count_inpatient` and the count of male outpatients as `count_outpatient`, the formula for percentage deviation is:\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (count_inpatient - count_outpatient) / count_outpatient * 100\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of male in-patients):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'M' AND Admission = '+') AS count_inpatient\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of male outpatients):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'M' AND Admission = '-') AS count_outpatient\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (percentage deviation):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT (count_inpatient - count_outpatient) * 100.0 / count_outpatient FROM (SELECT COUNT(ID) AS count_inpatient FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'M' AND Admission = '+') AS inpatient_count, (SELECT COUNT(ID) AS count_outpatient FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'M' AND Admission = '-') AS outpatient_count)\n\n* **Main Question (final output):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT count_inpatient, count_outpatient, (count_inpatient - count_outpatient) * 100.0 / count_outpatient AS percentage_deviation FROM (SELECT COUNT(ID) AS count_inpatient FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'M' AND Admission = '+') AS inpatient_count, (SELECT COUNT(ID) AS count_outpatient FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'M' AND Admission = '-') AS outpatient_count\n\n**3.
