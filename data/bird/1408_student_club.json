We need to filter the expenses to include only those with the description 'Parking'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`cost`) FROM `expense` WHERE <expense_description = 'Parking'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** expense_description = 'Parking'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `expense_description` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `expense_description` = 'Parking'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (expense_description = 'Parking'):**\n    * **SQL:** `expense_description` = 'Parking'\n\n* **Main Question (total cost spent for Parking):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`cost`) FROM `expense` WHERE `expense_description` = 'Parking'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly uses the `SUM()` function on the `cost` column with a simple `WHERE` clause to filter for 'Parking'.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
