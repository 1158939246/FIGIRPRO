Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the full name of the top five members who spend the most money in the descending order of spending.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the full names of members and their total spending from the `expense` table. The total spending can be calculated using the `SUM()` function on the `cost` column. We will group the results by member and order them by total spending in descending order.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` GROUP BY `T2`.`member_id` ORDER BY SUM(`T1`.`cost`) DESC LIMIT 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate total spending for each member\n        * **Analysis:** This involves summing the `cost` from the `expense` table for each member.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`T1`.`cost`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Join member and expense tables\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `member` table with the `expense` table on the `link_to_member` column to associate expenses with the respective members.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total spending for each member):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`T1`.`cost`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (join member and expense tables):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id`\n\n* **Main Question (top five members by spending):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` GROUP BY `T2`.`member_id` ORDER BY SUM(`T1`.`cost`) DESC LIMIT 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause ensures we aggregate the spending correctly. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order of total spending, and the `LIMIT` clause restricts the output to the top five members.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
