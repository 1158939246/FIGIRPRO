Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patients with a normal range of creatinine phosphokinase, how many of them have a positive measure of degree of coagulation?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the patients who have a CPK value less than 250 and also have at least one of the coagulation measures (KCT, RVVT, LAC) positive. This requires filtering based on the `Laboratory` table for CPK and the coagulation measures.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` WHERE <normal range of CPK> AND <positive measure of coagulation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal range of CPK  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `CPK` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`CPK` < 250\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** positive measure of coagulation  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking three columns (`KCT`, `RVVT`, `LAC`) for positive values. We can combine these conditions using the `OR` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`KCT` = '+' OR `T1`.`RVVT` = '+' OR `T1`.`LAC` = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal range of CPK):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`CPK` < 250\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (positive measure of coagulation):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`KCT` = '+' OR `T1`.`RVVT` = '+' OR `T1`.`LAC` = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`CPK` < 250 AND (`T1`.`KCT` = '+' OR `T1`.`RVVT` = '+' OR `T1`.`LAC` = '+')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause that combines the necessary conditions. There are no nested queries or unnecessary joins since all required information is contained within the `Laboratory` table.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
