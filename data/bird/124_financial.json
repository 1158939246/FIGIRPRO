Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the loan ID, district and average salary for loan with duration of 60 months.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `loan_id`, `district`, and `average salary` for loans that have a duration of 60 months. The `loan` table contains the `loan_id` and `duration`, while the `district` table contains the `district` and `average salary`. We will need to join these tables based on the `district_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`loan_id`, `T2`.`A2` AS `district`, `T2`.`A11` AS `average_salary` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`duration` = 60\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter loans with duration of 60 months\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `loan` table using the `duration` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`duration` = 60\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Join to get district and average salary\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `loan` table with the `district` table to get the district name and average salary. The join condition will be based on the `account_id` in the `loan` table and the `district_id` in the `district` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`district_id`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter loans with duration of 60 months):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`duration` = 60\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (join to get district and average salary):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`district_id`\n\n* **Main Question (select loan ID, district, and average salary):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`loan_id`, `T2`.`A2` AS `district`, `T2`.`A11` AS `average_salary` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`duration` = 60\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
