Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What's the code for the set which was released on 2017/7/14? \n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the `code` of the set, which is found in the `sets` table. We need to filter the results based on the `releaseDate`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `code` FROM `sets` WHERE <released on 2017/7/14>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** released on 2017/7/14\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `releaseDate` column in the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `releaseDate` = '2017-07-14'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (released on 2017/7/14):**\n    * **SQL:** `releaseDate` = '2017-07-14'\n\n* **Main Question (code of the set):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `code` FROM `sets` WHERE `releaseDate` = '2017-07-14'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient and straightforward. It directly retrieves the `code` based on the specified release date.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
