Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List out the account numbers of clients who are youngest and have highest average salary.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the account numbers of clients based on two criteria: they must be the youngest and have the highest average salary. The `client` table contains the `birth_date`, and the `district` table contains the `A11` column for average salary. We will need to join these tables and filter accordingly.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `account_id` FROM `disp` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `client` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`district_id` = `T3`.`district_id` WHERE <youngest client> AND <highest average salary>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** youngest client\n        * **Analysis:** To find the youngest client, we can use the `MIN(birth_date)` function to get the minimum birth date, which corresponds to the youngest age.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`birth_date` = (SELECT MIN(`birth_date`) FROM `client`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest average salary\n        * **Analysis:** To find the highest average salary, we can use the `MAX(A11)` function from the `district` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`A11` = (SELECT MAX(`A11`) FROM `district`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (youngest client):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`birth_date` = (SELECT MIN(`birth_date`) FROM `client`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest average salary):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`A11` = (SELECT MAX(`A11`) FROM `district`)\n\n* **Main Question (account numbers of clients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id` FROM `disp` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `client` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`district_id` = `T3`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`birth_date` = (SELECT MIN(`birth_date`) FROM `client`) AND `T3`.`A11` = (SELECT MAX(`A11`) FROM `district`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applies the filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
