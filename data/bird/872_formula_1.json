We will join these tables based on the `driverId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`code` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <Q3 time condition> AND <race condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Q3 time condition  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the qualifying times to find those that match the specified Q3 time of '0:01:33'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`q3` LIKE '0:01:33%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race condition  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to only include those from race number 45.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 45\n\n**2.
