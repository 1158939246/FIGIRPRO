The 'schools' table is also necessary as it contains the 'County' and the address fields (Street, City, State, and Zip) required to construct the full communication address. We will join these two tables on the 'CDSCode' to get the relevant data for high schools in Monterey.

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State the names and full communication address of high schools in Monterey which has more than 800 free or reduced price meals for ages 15-17?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `School Name` and the full communication address, which includes `Street`, `City`, `State`, and `Zip`. We will filter for high schools located in Monterey and having more than 800 free or reduced price meals for ages 15-17.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`School Name`, `T2`.`Street`, `T2`.`City`, `T2`.`State`, `T2`.`Zip` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <more than 800 free or reduced price meals> AND <high schools in Monterey>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** more than 800 free or reduced price meals\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` column in the `frpm` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` > 800\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** high schools in Monterey\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `schools` table for high schools located in Monterey. This can be done by checking the `City` column and the `School Type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`City` = 'Monterey' AND `T2`.`School Type` LIKE '%High School%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (more than 800 free or reduced price meals):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` > 800\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (high schools in Monterey):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`City` = 'Monterey' AND `T2`.`School Type` LIKE '%High School%'\n\n* **Main Question (names and addresses):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`School Name`, `T2`.`Street`, `T2`.`City`, `T2`.`State`, `T2`.`Zip` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` > 800 AND `T2`.`City` = 'Monterey' AND `T2`.`School Type` LIKE '%High School%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
