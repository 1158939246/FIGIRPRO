Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list top two bonds that happened with the molecule TR006 in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the top two bonds associated with the molecule TR006, sorted in alphabetical order. The relevant information is in the `bond` table, where we can filter by `molecule_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `bond_id` FROM `bond` WHERE `molecule_id` = 'TR006' ORDER BY `bond_id` ASC LIMIT 2\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bonds associated with TR006\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `molecule_id` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `molecule_id` = 'TR006'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** order by bond_id\n        * **Analysis:** We need to sort the results by `bond_id` in ascending order.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `bond_id` ASC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bonds associated with TR006):**\n    * **SQL:** `molecule_id` = 'TR006'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (order by bond_id):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `bond_id` ASC\n\n* **Main Question (top two bonds):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `bond_id` FROM `bond` WHERE `molecule_id` = 'TR006' ORDER BY `bond_id` ASC LIMIT 2\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `bond` table for the specified `molecule_id`, sorts the results, and limits the output to the top two entries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
