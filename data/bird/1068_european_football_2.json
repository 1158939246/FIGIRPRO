Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** From 2010 to 2015, what was the average overall rating of players who are higher than 170?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average overall rating of players based on their height and the date of their attributes.

This will be done using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the `date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', t1.date) >= '2010' AND STRFTIME('%Y', t1.date) <= '2015'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (height condition):**\n    * **SQL:** t2.height > 170\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date condition):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', t1.date) >= '2010' AND STRFTIME('%Y', t1.date) <= '2015'\n\n* **Main Question (average overall rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(t2.overall_rating) FROM Player_Attributes AS t1 INNER JOIN Player AS t2 ON t1.player_fifa_api_id = t2.player_fifa_api_id WHERE t2.height > 170 AND STRFTIME('%Y', t1.date) >= '2010' AND STRFTIME('%Y', t1.date) <= '2015'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player_Attributes` and `Player` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
