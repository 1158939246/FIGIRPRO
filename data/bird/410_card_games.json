The ID of the card will be selected if these conditions are met.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <artist is Erica Yang> AND <format is pauper> AND <available in paper>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** artist is Erica Yang\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `artist` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`artist` = 'Erica Yang'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** format is pauper\n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking the `format` column in the `legalities` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`format` = 'pauper'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** available in paper\n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking the `availability` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`availability` = 'paper'\n\n**2.
