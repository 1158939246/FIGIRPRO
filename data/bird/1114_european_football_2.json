Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the average overall rating for Marko Arnautovic from 2007/2/22 to 2016/4/21?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of the `overall_rating` for the player named Marko Arnautovic, filtered by the date range specified. This requires joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on `player_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`overall_rating`) FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <Marko Arnautovic> AND <date range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Marko Arnautovic  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`player_name` = 'Marko Arnautovic'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date range  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Player_Attributes` table based on the `date` column, ensuring it falls within the specified range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date` BETWEEN '2007-02-22' AND '2016-04-21'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Marko Arnautovic):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`player_name` = 'Marko Arnautovic'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date range):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`date` BETWEEN '2007-02-22' AND '2016-04-21'\n\n* **Main Question (average overall rating):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`overall_rating`) FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`player_name` = 'Marko Arnautovic' AND `T2`.`date` BETWEEN '2007-02-22' AND '2016-04-21'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
