Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the cards in set 10E with converted mana of 5 that have translation and what are the languages?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the card names and their corresponding languages for cards that belong to the set '10E' and have a converted mana cost of 5. This requires joining the `cards` table with the `set_translations` table based on the card's UUID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`language` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <setCode = '10E'> AND <convertedManaCost = 5> AND <translation exists>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** setCode = '10E'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table to find the relevant set.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`setCode` = '10E'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** convertedManaCost = 5\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied directly to the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`convertedManaCost` = 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** translation exists\n        * **Analysis:** We need to ensure that there is a translation for the card in the `set_translations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (setCode = '10E'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`setCode` = '10E'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (convertedManaCost = 5):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`convertedManaCost` = 5\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (translation exists):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (cards and languages):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`language` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T1`.`setCode` = '10E' AND `T1`.`convertedManaCost` = 5 AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
