This requires joining the `event` table with the `budget` table based on the `event_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE <budget category is food>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** budget category is food\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `budget` table using the `category` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`category` = 'Food'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (budget category is food):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`category` = 'Food'\n\n* **Main Question (event names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE `T2`.`category` = 'Food'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
