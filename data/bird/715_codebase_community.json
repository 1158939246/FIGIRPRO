Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In comments with score between 1 to 5, list down the display names of the users with 0 down votes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `DisplayName` from the `users` table for users who have 0 down votes and have made comments with a score between 1 and 5. This requires joining the `comments` and `users` tables based on `UserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`DisplayName` FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <score between 1 and 5> AND <down votes = 0>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** score between 1 and 5\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `comments` table using the `Score` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Score` BETWEEN 1 AND 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** down votes = 0\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `users` table using the `DownVotes` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`DownVotes` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (score between 1 and 5):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Score` BETWEEN 1 AND 5\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (down votes = 0):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`DownVotes` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (display names of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`DisplayName` FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Score` BETWEEN 1 AND 5 AND `T2`.`DownVotes` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
