We need to filter the data to include only the records for Aaron Lennox, which requires joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the `player_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`crossing`) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <Aaron Lennox>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Aaron Lennox\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`player_name` = 'Aaron Lennox'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Aaron Lennox):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`player_name` = 'Aaron Lennox'\n\n* **Main Question (total crossing score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`crossing`) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`player_name` = 'Aaron Lennox'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
