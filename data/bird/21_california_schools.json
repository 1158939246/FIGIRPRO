Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In Los Angeles how many schools have more than 500 free meals but less than 700 free or reduced price meals for K-12?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of schools that meet the specified criteria for free meals and free or reduced price meals. The relevant columns are `Free Meal Count (K-12)` and `FRPM Count (K-12)` from the `frpm` table. We also need to filter by the city, which is indicated in the `schools` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`School Code` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <conditions on meals> AND <city is Los Angeles>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** conditions on meals\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter for schools with more than 500 free meals and less than 700 free or reduced price meals.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500 AND `T1`.`FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** city is Los Angeles\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter the schools based on the `City` column in the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`City` = 'Los Angeles'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (conditions on meals):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500 AND `T1`.`FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (city is Los Angeles):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`City` = 'Los Angeles'\n\n* **Main Question (count of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`School Code` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500 AND `T1`.`FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700 AND `T2`.`City` = 'Los Angeles'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables and applied the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
