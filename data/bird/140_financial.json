We need to filter these accounts based on the district name, which is found in the `district` table. This requires a join between the `account` and `district` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`account_id`) FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <district name is \"Pisek\">\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** district name is \"Pisek\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `district` table using the `A2` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A2` = 'Pisek'\n\n**2.
