Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the male patients who have a normal level of white blood cells, how many of them have an abnormal fibrinogen level?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the distinct male patients who meet the criteria for both normal white blood cell levels and abnormal fibrinogen levels. This requires filtering based on the `SEX`, `WBC`, and `FG` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <normal WBC levels> AND <abnormal fibrinogen levels>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal WBC levels\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `WBC` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it falls within the normal range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` > 3.5 AND `T2`.`WBC` < 9.0\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** abnormal fibrinogen levels\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `FG` column in the `Laboratory` table to check for abnormal levels.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`FG` <= 150 OR `T2`.`FG` >= 450\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal WBC levels):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` > 3.5 AND `T2`.`WBC` < 9.0\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (abnormal fibrinogen levels):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`FG` <= 150 OR `T2`.`FG` >= 450\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct male patients with normal WBC and abnormal fibrinogen):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `T2`.`WBC` > 3.5 AND `T2`.`WBC` < 9.0 AND (`T2`.`FG` <= 150 OR `T2`.`FG` >= 450)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. There are no unnecessary nested queries or complex sub-selections.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
