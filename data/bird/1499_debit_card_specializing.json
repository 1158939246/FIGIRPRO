Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the biggest monthly consumption of the customers who use euro as their currency? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the monthly consumption for customers using euro as their currency. This involves summing the consumption from the `yearmonth` table for those customers and then dividing by 12 to get the monthly average. Finally, we will find the maximum of these monthly consumptions.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(SUM(`Consumption`) / 12) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR' GROUP BY `T1`.`CustomerID`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter customers using euro as their currency\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Calculate monthly consumption\n        * **Analysis:** We will sum the `Consumption` for each customer and divide by 12.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`Consumption`) / 12\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter customers using euro):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (calculate monthly consumption):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`Consumption`) / 12\n\n* **Main Question (biggest monthly consumption):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) / 12) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR' GROUP BY `T1`.`CustomerID`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `yearmonth` and `customers` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we calculate the monthly consumption for each customer before finding the maximum.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
