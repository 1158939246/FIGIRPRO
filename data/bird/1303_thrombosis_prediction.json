Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** When is the birthday of the oldest patient whose blood glucose is abnormal?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the minimum birthday from the `Patient` table for patients whose blood glucose level (from the `Laboratory` table) is greater than 180. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MIN(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <blood glucose is abnormal>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** blood glucose is abnormal  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `GLU` column from the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GLU` > 180\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (blood glucose is abnormal):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GLU` > 180\n\n* **Main Question (birthday of the oldest patient):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT MIN(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GLU` > 180\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
