This involves two tables: `lapTimes` for the lap times and `drivers` for the driver's full name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`forename`, `T2`.`surname` FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <best lap time in race 348>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** best lap time in race 348\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `lapTimes` table for raceId 348 and find the minimum lap time.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 348 AND `T1`.`time` = (SELECT MIN(`time`) FROM `lapTimes` WHERE `raceId` = 348)\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
