Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many distinct atoms with iodine and sulfur type elements are there in single bond molecules?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct atoms that are either iodine or sulfur and are part of single bond molecules. This requires filtering based on the `element` in the `atom` table and the `bond_type` in the `bond` table. We will need to join the `atom`, `bond`, and `molecule` tables to ensure we are only counting atoms in single bond molecules.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`atom_id`) FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <atoms are iodine or sulfur> AND <bond type is single>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** atoms are iodine or sulfur\n        * **Analysis:** This can be expressed as a condition on the `element` column in the `atom` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`element` IN ('i', 's')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** bond type is single\n        * **Analysis:** This can be expressed as a condition on the `bond_type` column in the `bond` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (atoms are iodine or sulfur):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`element` IN ('i', 's')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (bond type is single):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`atom_id`) FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`element` IN ('i', 's') AND `T2`.`bond_type` = '-'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
