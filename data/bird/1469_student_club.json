List their full name and position.  \n**Evidence**: full name refers to first_name, last_name, hometown of Lincolnton, North Carolina refers to city = 'Lincolnton' AND state = 'North Carolina'\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which student has the hometown of Lincolnton, North Carolina with the zip code of 28092? List their full name and position.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `position` of the student from the `member` table. The filtering criteria include the city and state from the `zip_code` table, which requires a join between `member` and `zip_code`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T1`.`position` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE <hometown is Lincolnton, North Carolina> AND <zip code is 28092>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** hometown is Lincolnton, North Carolina\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will be applied to the `zip_code` table, checking both the `city` and `state` columns.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`city` = 'Lincolnton' AND `T2`.`state` = 'North Carolina'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** zip code is 28092\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will also be applied to the `zip_code` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`zip_code` = 28092\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (hometown is Lincolnton, North Carolina):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`city` = 'Lincolnton' AND `T2`.`state` = 'North Carolina'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (zip code is 28092):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`zip_code` = 28092\n\n* **Main Question (full name and position):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T1`.`position` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T2`.`city` = 'Lincolnton' AND `T2`.`state` = 'North Carolina' AND `T2`.`zip_code` = 28092\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `zip_code` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
