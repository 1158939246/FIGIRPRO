Please give its website.  \n**Evidence**: the time of the champion shows in the format of \"minutes: seconds.millionsecond\" in which Max(time); constructor reference name refers to constructorRef; website refers to url.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the constructor reference name of the champion in the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix? Please give its website.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the constructor reference name and website of the champion, which requires us to identify the race (2009 Singapore Grand Prix) and then find the driver with the fastest time in that race.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`constructorRef`, `T2`.`url` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `constructors` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`constructorId` = `T2`.`constructorId` WHERE <champion's time> AND <race is 2009 Singapore Grand Prix>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** champion's time\n        * **Analysis:** The champion's time is the minimum time in the results for the race. We will need to filter the results for the specific race and find the minimum time.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`time` = (SELECT MIN(`T1`.`time`) FROM `results` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`raceId` = <raceId of 2009 Singapore Grand Prix>)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race is 2009 Singapore Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the raceId for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix from the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2009 AND `name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (champion's time):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`time` = (SELECT MIN(`T1`.`time`) FROM `results` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2009 AND `name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix'))\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race is 2009 Singapore Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2009 AND `name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix')\n\n* **Main Question (constructor reference name and website):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`constructorRef`, `T2`.`url` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `constructors` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`constructorId` = `T2`.`constructorId` WHERE `T1`.`time` = (SELECT MIN(`T1`.`time`) FROM `results` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2009 AND `name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix'))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `results` and `races` tables to filter for the specific race and then finding the minimum time in a single query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
