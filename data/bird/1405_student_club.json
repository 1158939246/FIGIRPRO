List all the budgeted categories for said event in an ascending order based on their amount budgeted.  \n**Evidence**: 'April Speaker' is an event name; amount budgeted refers to SUM(amount); budget categories refers to category.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the amount budgeted for 'April Speaker' event. List all the budgeted categories for said event in an ascending order based on their amount budgeted.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to sum the budgeted amounts for the 'April Speaker' event and group the results by category. The results should be ordered by the amount budgeted in ascending order.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `category`, SUM(`amount`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'April Speaker' GROUP BY `category` ORDER BY SUM(`amount`) ASC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for 'April Speaker' event\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `event_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'April Speaker'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Group by budget categories\n        * **Analysis:** We will group the results by the `category` column in the `budget` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** GROUP BY `T1`.`category`\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Sum the budgeted amounts\n        * **Analysis:** We will use the `SUM()` function to calculate the total amount for each category.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`T1`.`amount`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter for 'April Speaker' event):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'April Speaker'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (group by budget categories):**\n    * **SQL:** GROUP BY `T1`.`category`\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (sum the budgeted amounts):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`T1`.`amount`)\n\n* **Main Question (final SQL):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`category`, SUM(`T1`.`amount`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'April Speaker' GROUP BY `T1`.`category` ORDER BY SUM(`T1`.`amount`) ASC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the `budget` and `event` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
