Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients born after 1980/1/1 have an abnormal fibrinogen level?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who meet two criteria: they were born after January 1, 1980, and their fibrinogen level (FG) is outside the normal range (i.e., less than 150 or greater than 450).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T1`.`ID` WHERE <born after 1980/1/1> AND <abnormal fibrinogen level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born after 1980/1/1\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Birthday` > '1980-01-01'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** abnormal fibrinogen level\n        * **Analysis:** The normal range for fibrinogen (FG) is between 150 and 450, so we need to filter for values that are either less than 150 or greater than 450.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`FG` < 150 OR `T1`.`FG` > 450\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born after 1980/1/1):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Birthday` > '1980-01-01'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (abnormal fibrinogen level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`FG` < 150 OR `T1`.`FG` > 450\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T1`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`Birthday` > '1980-01-01' AND (`T1`.`FG` < 150 OR `T1`.`FG` > 450)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
