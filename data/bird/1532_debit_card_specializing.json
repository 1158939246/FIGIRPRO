This involves joining the `transactions_1k`, `gasstations`, and `products` tables to filter by the specific product and then determine the maximum price.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Country` FROM `gasstations` AS `G` INNER JOIN `transactions_1k` AS `T` ON `G`.`GasStationID` = `T`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T`.`ProductID` = 2 AND `T`.`Price` = (SELECT MAX(`Price`) FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `ProductID` = 2)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum price for product id No.2\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation to find the maximum price for the specified product.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`Price`) FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `ProductID` = 2\n\n**2.
