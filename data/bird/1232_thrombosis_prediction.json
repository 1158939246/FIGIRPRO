Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide ID, sex and age of patient who has blood glucose (GLU) not within normal range but with total cholesterol (T-CHO) within normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID`, `SEX`, and calculate the `age` of patients based on the conditions provided for `GLU` and `T-CHO`. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, <age calculation> FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <GLU condition> AND <T-CHO condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** GLU condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter for patients with blood glucose levels greater than or equal to 180.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GLU` >= 180\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** T-CHO condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter for patients with total cholesterol levels less than 250.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`T-CHO` < 250\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Age calculation\n        * **Analysis:** The age can be calculated using the `Birthday` column from the `Patient` table. We will use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year and calculate the age.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SUBTRACT(YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), YEAR(T1.Birthday))`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (GLU condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GLU` >= 180\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (T-CHO condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`T-CHO` < 250\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (age calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', T1.Birthday)`\n\n* **Main Question (ID, sex, and age):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`)) AS age FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GLU` >= 180 AND `T2`.`T-CHO` < 250\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applying the filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
