Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Write all the comments left by users who edited the post titled 'Why square the difference instead of taking the absolute value in standard deviation?'\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve comments associated with the post that has the specified title. This involves joining the `comments` table with the `postHistory` table to find edits related to the post, and then filtering by the post title in the `posts` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `postHistory` AS `PH` ON `C`.`PostId` = `PH`.`PostId` WHERE <post title matches> \n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** post title matches\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the `Id` of the post with the specified title from the `posts` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `PH`.`PostId` IN (SELECT `P`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `P` WHERE `P`.`Title` = 'Why square the difference instead of taking the absolute value in standard deviation?')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (post title matches):**\n    * **SQL:** `PH`.`PostId` IN (SELECT `P`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `P` WHERE `P`.`Title` = 'Why square the difference instead of taking the absolute value in standard deviation?')\n\n* **Main Question (comments left by users who edited the post):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `postHistory` AS `PH` ON `C`.`PostId` = `PH`.`PostId` WHERE `PH`.`PostId` IN (SELECT `P`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `P` WHERE `P`.`Title` = 'Why square the difference instead of taking the absolute value in standard deviation?')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to connect the `comments` and `postHistory` tables based on the `PostId`, and we are filtering the results based on the title of the post.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
