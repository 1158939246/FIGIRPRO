List out the card id.\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of card IDs where the border color is black. We will select the `id` column from the `cards` table and count the number of entries that meet the condition.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`id`), `id` FROM `cards` WHERE <border color is black>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** border color is black\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `borderColor` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `borderColor` = 'black'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (border color is black):**\n    * **SQL:** `borderColor` = 'black'\n\n* **Main Question (count of card IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`id`), `id` FROM `cards` WHERE `borderColor` = 'black'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 can be simplified to ensure we only select the IDs of cards with a black border and count them. We can use a `GROUP BY` clause to ensure we get distinct IDs.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
