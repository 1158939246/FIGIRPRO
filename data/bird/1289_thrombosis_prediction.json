This involves filtering the `Patient` table for the diagnosis and the `Laboratory` table for the total protein levels.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <diagnosed with SJS> AND <normal level of total protein>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** diagnosed with SJS\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`Diagnosis` = 'SJS'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal level of total protein\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `TP` column to ensure it falls within the specified range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`TP` > 6.0 AND `L`.`TP` < 8.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (diagnosed with SJS):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`Diagnosis` = 'SJS'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal level of total protein):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`TP` > 6.0 AND `L`.`TP` < 8.5\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`Diagnosis` = 'SJS' AND `L`.`TP` > 6.0 AND `L`.`TP` < 8.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
