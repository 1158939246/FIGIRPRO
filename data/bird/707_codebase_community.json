Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the posts with views ranging from 100 to 150, what is the comment with the highest score?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the comment with the highest score associated with posts that have a view count between 100 and 150. This requires joining the `comments` and `posts` tables based on the `PostId`, filtering by the `ViewCount`, and then selecting the comment with the maximum score.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Text` FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE <views are between 100 and 150> ORDER BY <highest score> LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** views are between 100 and 150\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `posts` table using the `ViewCount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`ViewCount` BETWEEN 100 AND 150\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest score\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum score from the `comments` table. This can be achieved using the `MAX()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `C`.`Score` = (SELECT MAX(`Score`) FROM `comments` AS `C2` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P2` ON `C2`.`PostId` = `P2`.`Id` WHERE `P2`.`ViewCount` BETWEEN 100 AND 150)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (views are between 100 and 150):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`ViewCount` BETWEEN 100 AND 150\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest score):**\n    * **SQL:** `C`.`Score` = (SELECT MAX(`C2`.`Score`) FROM `comments` AS `C2` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P2` ON `C2`.`PostId` = `P2`.`Id` WHERE `P2`.`ViewCount` BETWEEN 100 AND 150)\n\n* **Main Question (comment with highest score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE `P`.`ViewCount` BETWEEN 100 AND 150 AND `C`.`Score` = (SELECT MAX(`C2`.`Score`) FROM `comments` AS `C2` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P2` ON `C2`.`PostId` = `P2`.`Id` WHERE `P2`.`ViewCount` BETWEEN 100 AND 150)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 can be simplified by directly using a `ORDER BY` clause to get the highest score without needing a subquery for the maximum score.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
