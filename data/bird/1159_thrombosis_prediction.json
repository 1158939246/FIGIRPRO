This requires joining the `Patient` table with the `Laboratory` table based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <albumin level lower than 3.5>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** albumin level lower than 3.5\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `ALB` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ALB` < 3.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (albumin level lower than 3.5):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ALB` < 3.5\n\n* **Main Question (ID, sex, and diagnosis):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`ALB` < 3.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
