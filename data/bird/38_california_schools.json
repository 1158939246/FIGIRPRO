The relevant columns for this query are `cname` from the `satscores` table for the county name and `NumTstTakr` for the number of test takers.

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the webpages for the Los Angeles County school that has between 2,000 and 3,000 test takers?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to join the `satscores` and `schools` tables to get the webpage information for schools in Los Angeles County with the specified number of test takers.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Website` FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE <Los Angeles County> AND <between 2000 and 3000 test takers>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Los Angeles County\n        * **Analysis:** This can be filtered using the `cname` column in the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`cname` = 'Los Angeles'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** between 2000 and 3000 test takers\n        * **Analysis:** This can be filtered using the `NumTstTakr` column in the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`NumTstTakr` BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Los Angeles County):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`cname` = 'Los Angeles'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (between 2000 and 3000 test takers):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`NumTstTakr` BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000\n\n* **Main Question (webpages):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Website` FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE `T2`.`cname` = 'Los Angeles' AND `T2`.`NumTstTakr` BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000\n\n**3.
