Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the football player Francois Affolter header's finishing rate on 18/09/2014?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `heading_accuracy` for the player Francois Affolter on the specified date. This requires joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the player's ID and filtering by the player's name and the date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`heading_accuracy` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`player_name` = 'Francois Affolter' AND `T2`.`date` = '2014-09-18 00:00:00'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the player Francois Affolter  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`player_name` = 'Francois Affolter'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by date  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Player_Attributes` table directly based on the `date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date` = '2014-09-18 00:00:00'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify the player):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`player_name` = 'Francois Affolter'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Filter by date):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`date` = '2014-09-18 00:00:00'\n\n* **Main Question (heading accuracy):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`heading_accuracy` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`player_name` = 'Francois Affolter' AND `T2`.`date` = '2014-09-18 00:00:00'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
