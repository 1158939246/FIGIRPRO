This requires joining the `transactions_1k` table with the `gasstations` table based on `GasStationID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `Time` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T2`.`ChainID` = 11\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (distinct times of transactions):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`Time` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T2`.`ChainID` = 11\n\n**3.
