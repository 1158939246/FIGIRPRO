They may act in their own self-interest or make decisions based on their own moral code.

We will use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average height.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`height_cm`) FROM `superhero` GROUP BY `superhero_name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate the average height\n        * **Analysis:** This involves using the `AVG()` function on the `height_cm` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** AVG(`height_cm`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Group by each superhero\n        * **Analysis:** We need to group the results by the superhero's name to get the average height for each individual superhero.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** GROUP BY `superhero_name`\n\n**2.
