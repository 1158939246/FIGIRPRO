Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average weight of all female superheroes?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate the average weight of superheroes filtered by gender. The `weight_kg` column in the `superhero` table will be used for the average calculation, and we need to filter by female superheroes using the `gender` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`weight_kg`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <gender is female>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** gender is female\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `gender` table using the `gender` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`gender` = 'Female'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (gender is female):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`gender` = 'Female'\n\n* **Main Question (average weight):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`weight_kg`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`gender` = 'Female'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `gender` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
