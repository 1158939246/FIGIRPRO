Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find and list the names of sets which don't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the names of sets from the `sets` table that meet the specified translation criteria. This requires joining the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table to filter based on the translations available.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <have Korean translation> AND <don't have Japanese translation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** have Korean translation\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if there is a translation for the set in Korean.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Korean'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** don't have Japanese translation\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks that there is no translation for the set in Japanese.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` NOT LIKE '%Japanese%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (have Korean translation):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Korean'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (don't have Japanese translation):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` NOT LIKE '%Japanese%'\n\n* **Main Question (names of sets):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`language` = 'Korean' AND `T2`.`language` NOT LIKE '%Japanese%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by ensuring that we check for the existence of the Korean translation and the non-existence of the Japanese translation in a single query. We can use a `GROUP BY` clause to ensure we only get distinct set names.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
