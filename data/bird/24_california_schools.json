Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Give the names of the schools with the percent eligible for free meals in K-12 is more than 0.1 and test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter schools based on two criteria: the percent eligible for free meals must be greater than 0.1, and the number of test takers with scores greater than or equal to 1500 must be considered. The relevant columns are in the `frpm` and `satscores` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE <percent eligible for free meals > 0.1 AND <test takers with score >= 1500>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** percent eligible for free meals > 0.1\n        * **Analysis:** This can be calculated using the formula: `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`. We need to ensure that the denominator is not zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0.1 AND `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** test takers with score >= 1500\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks the `NumGE1500` column in the `satscores` table, which represents the number of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater than or equal to 1500.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`NumGE1500` > 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (percent eligible for free meals > 0.1):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0.1 AND `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (test takers with score >= 1500):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`NumGE1500` > 0\n\n* **Main Question (names of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE `T1`.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0.1 AND `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0 AND `T2`.`NumGE1500` > 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
