Also state the name, date and time of the race.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the youngest driver based on their date of birth and then find the first qualifying race for that driver. The output should include the year of the race, the name of the driver, and the date and time of the race.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `year`, `name`, `date`, `time` FROM `drivers` AS `D` INNER JOIN `qualifying` AS `Q` ON `D`.`driverId` = `Q`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `R` ON `Q`.`raceId` = `R`.`raceId` WHERE <youngest driver> AND <first qualifying race>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** youngest driver\n        * **Analysis:** To find the youngest driver, we need to select the maximum date of birth from the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `D`.`dob` = (SELECT MAX(`dob`) FROM `drivers`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** first qualifying race\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the minimum date of the race for the qualifying of the youngest driver.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `R`.`date` = (SELECT MIN(`R2`.`date`) FROM `races` AS `R2` INNER JOIN `qualifying` AS `Q2` ON `R2`.`raceId` = `Q2`.`raceId` WHERE `Q2`.`driverId` = `D`.`driverId`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (youngest driver):**\n    * **SQL:** `D`.`dob` = (SELECT MAX(`dob`) FROM `drivers`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (first qualifying race):**\n    * **SQL:** `R`.`date` = (SELECT MIN(`R2`.`date`) FROM `races` AS `R2` INNER JOIN `qualifying` AS `Q2` ON `R2`.`raceId` = `Q2`.`raceId` WHERE `Q2`.`driverId` = `D`.`driverId`)\n\n* **Main Question (year, name, date, and time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT STRFTIME('%Y', `R`.`date`) AS `year`, `D`.`forename`, `D`.`surname`, `R`.`date`, `R`.`time` FROM `drivers` AS `D` INNER JOIN `qualifying` AS `Q` ON `D`.`driverId` = `Q`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `R` ON `Q`.`raceId` = `R`.`raceId` WHERE `D`.`dob` = (SELECT MAX(`dob`) FROM `drivers`) AND `R`.`date` = (SELECT MIN(`R2`.`date`) FROM `races` AS `R2` INNER JOIN `qualifying` AS `Q2` ON `R2`.`raceId` = `Q2`.`raceId` WHERE `Q2`.`driverId` = `D`.`driverId`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filtering based on the youngest driver's date of birth and the first qualifying race date.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
