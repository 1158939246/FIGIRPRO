To do this, we need to filter the expenses related to the 'Yearly Kickoff' event. This requires joining the `expense` table with the `budget` table to link expenses to their respective events.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`cost`) FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_budget` = `T2`.`budget_id` WHERE <event name is Yearly Kickoff>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event name is Yearly Kickoff\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `budget` table to find the `link_to_event` that corresponds to the 'Yearly Kickoff' event name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`link_to_event` IN (SELECT `event_id` FROM `event` WHERE `event_name` = 'Yearly Kickoff')\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to connect the `expense` and `budget` tables, and we have a clear filter for the event name. \n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
