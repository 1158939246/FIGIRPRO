Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please provide the diagnosis of patients with ALT glutamic pyruvic transaminase beyond the normal range by ascending order of their date of birth.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `Diagnosis` from the `Patient` table for patients whose `GPT` value in the `Laboratory` table exceeds 60. We will join the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables on the `ID` column and filter based on the `GPT` value. Finally, we will order the results by the `Birthday` column in ascending order.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <GPT > 60> ORDER BY `T2`.`Birthday` ASC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** GPT > 60\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `GPT` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`GPT` > 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (GPT > 60):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`GPT` > 60\n\n* **Main Question (diagnosis of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`GPT` > 60 ORDER BY `T2`.`Birthday` ASC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The ordering is also straightforward.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
