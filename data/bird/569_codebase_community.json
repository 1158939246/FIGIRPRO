The post is identified by its title containing 'data visualization'. This requires joining the `posts` table with the `votes` table based on the `PostId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`Id`) FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <Title contains 'data visualization'>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** Title contains 'data visualization'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `Title` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Title` LIKE '%data visualization%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (Title contains 'data visualization'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Title` LIKE '%data visualization%'\n\n* **Main Question (count of votes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`Id`) FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Title` LIKE '%data visualization%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
