Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (set name):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Journey into Nyx Hero''s Path'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (order by converted mana cost):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`convertedManaCost` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (highest converted mana cost):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Journey into Nyx Hero''s Path' ORDER BY `T1`.`convertedManaCost` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `cards` and `sets` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
