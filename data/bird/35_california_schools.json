Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the administrator's email address of the chartered school with the fewest students enrolled in grades 1 through 12?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the administrator's email address from the `schools` table for the chartered school that has the minimum enrollment in grades 1 through 12. This requires filtering the `frpm` table for chartered schools and then joining it with the `schools` table to get the email address.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`AdmEmail1` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`School Code` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <chartered school> ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** chartered school  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `frpm` table where we select rows with `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** minimum enrollment in grades 1 through 12  \n        * **Analysis:** We will order the results by `Enrollment (K-12)` in ascending order and limit the results to 1 to get the school with the fewest students.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ORDER BY T1.`Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (chartered school):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (minimum enrollment):**  \n    * **SQL:** `ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Main Question (administrator's email address):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`AdmEmail1` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`School Code` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 ORDER BY `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The ordering and limiting are correctly applied to get the desired result.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
