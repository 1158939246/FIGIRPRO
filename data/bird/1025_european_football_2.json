This involves summing the goals from both home and away teams and grouping by league.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `League` AS `L` INNER JOIN `Match` AS `M` ON `L`.`id` = `M`.`league_id` WHERE `season` = '2015/2016' GROUP BY `L`.`name` ORDER BY SUM(`home_team_goal` + `away_team_goal`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate total goals for each league in the 2016 season\n        * **Analysis:** We need to sum the goals from both home and away teams for matches in the specified season.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`home_team_goal` + `away_team_goal`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter for the 2016 season\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Match` table using the `season` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `season` = '2015/2016'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total goals for each league):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`home_team_goal` + `away_team_goal`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (filter for the 2016 season):**\n    * **SQL:** `season` = '2015/2016'\n\n* **Main Question (league with the most goals):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `L`.`name` FROM `League` AS `L` INNER JOIN `Match` AS `M` ON `L`.`id` = `M`.`league_id` WHERE `M`.`season` = '2015/2016' GROUP BY `L`.`name` ORDER BY SUM(`M`.`home_team_goal` + `M`.`away_team_goal`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `League` and `Match` tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause ensures we aggregate the goals by league. The `ORDER BY` clause allows us to find the league with the maximum goals.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
