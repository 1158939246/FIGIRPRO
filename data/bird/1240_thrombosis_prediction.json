Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** From laboratory examinations in 1991, what is the average hematoclit level that is lower than the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of the `HCT` column from the `Laboratory` table, filtering for records from 1991 and where the `HCT` value is less than 29.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`HCT`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE <laboratory examinations in 1991> AND <HCT lower than normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** laboratory examinations in 1991\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied directly to the `Date` column in the `Laboratory` table using the `LIKE` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Date` LIKE '1991%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** HCT lower than normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `HCT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `HCT` < 29\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (laboratory examinations in 1991):**\n    * **SQL:** `Date` LIKE '1991%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (HCT lower than normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `HCT` < 29\n\n* **Main Question (average hematoclit level):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`HCT`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `Date` LIKE '1991%' AND `HCT` < 29\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the specified conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
