Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For patient born between Year 1930 to 1940, how many percent of them were inpatient?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of patients who were admitted (inpatients) out of the total number of patients born in the specified range. This requires counting both the total number of patients and the number of inpatients.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(<inpatients>) * 100.0 / COUNT(<total patients>)) AS percentage FROM Patient WHERE <patients born between 1930 and 1940>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** patients born between Year 1930 to 1940\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Birthday` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(Birthday) BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** inpatients\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the patients who have an `Admission` value of '+'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** Admission = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patients born between Year 1930 to 1940):**\n    * **SQL:** YEAR(Birthday) BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (inpatients):**\n    * **SQL:** Admission = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage of inpatients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '+' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage FROM Patient WHERE YEAR(Birthday) BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `CASE` statement to count inpatients and a `COUNT(*)` to get the total number of patients in the specified age range.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
