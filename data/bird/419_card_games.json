Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many color cards with no borders have been ranked higher than 12000 on EDHRec?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of cards that meet two criteria: they must have a `borderColor` of 'borderless' and an `edhrecRank` greater than 12000.  \n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <color cards with no borders> AND <ranked higher than 12000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** color cards with no borders  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `borderColor` column.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `borderColor` = 'borderless'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ranked higher than 12000  \n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `edhrecRank` column.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `edhrecRank` > 12000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (color cards with no borders):**  \n    * **SQL:** `borderColor` = 'borderless'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ranked higher than 12000):**  \n    * **SQL:** `edhrecRank` > 12000\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE `borderColor` = 'borderless' AND `edhrecRank` > 12000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of records in the `cards` table that meet both conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
