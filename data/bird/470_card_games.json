Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** When was the set of cards with \"Ancestor's Chosen\" released?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `releaseDate` for the set that contains the card named \"Ancestor's Chosen\". This requires joining the `cards` table with the `sets` table to filter by the card name and retrieve the corresponding release date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `releaseDate` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the card set for \"Ancestor's Chosen\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (card set for \"Ancestor's Chosen\"):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n* **Main Question (release date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`releaseDate` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `sets` and `cards` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
