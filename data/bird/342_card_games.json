We will need to select the `name` from the `cards` table and filter it based on the maximum `faceConvertedManaCost`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `faceConvertedManaCost` = <Max(faceConvertedManaCost)>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Max(faceConvertedManaCost)\n        * **Analysis:** This requires us to find the maximum value of the `faceConvertedManaCost` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`faceConvertedManaCost`) FROM `cards`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Max faceConvertedManaCost):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`faceConvertedManaCost`) FROM `cards`\n\n* **Main Question (card names with max faceConvertedManaCost):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `faceConvertedManaCost` = (SELECT MAX(`faceConvertedManaCost`) FROM `cards`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the maximum `faceConvertedManaCost` and filtering the main query based on that value.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
