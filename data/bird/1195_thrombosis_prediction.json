Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average blood albumin level for female patients with a PLT greater than 400 who have been diagnosed with SLE?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of the `ALB` column from the `Laboratory` table, but only for female patients who meet the specified criteria. This requires joining the `Laboratory`, `Patient`, and `Examination` tables based on their relationships.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`ALB`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T3`.`ID` WHERE <female patients> AND <PLT greater than 400> AND <diagnosed with SLE>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** PLT greater than 400  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `Laboratory` table using the `PLT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` > 400\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** diagnosed with SLE  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `Examination` table using the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (PLT greater than 400):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` > 400\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (diagnosed with SLE):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n* **Main Question (average blood albumin level):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`ALB`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T3`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`SEX` = 'F' AND `T1`.`PLT` > 400 AND `T3`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
