We will use the `COUNT()` function to get the total number of records that meet the criteria. The filtering will be done based on the `SEX` and `Diagnosis` columns in the `Patient` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` WHERE <female patients> AND <APS diagnosis>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SEX` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** APS diagnosis\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Diagnosis` = 'APS'\n\n**2.
