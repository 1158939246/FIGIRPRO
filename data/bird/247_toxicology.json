This requires a `NOT IN` condition to filter out atoms that have entries in the `connected` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `element` FROM `atom` WHERE `atom_id` NOT IN (<sub-query>)\n\n    * **Sub-question:** Identify atom_ids that can bond with other atoms.\n        * **Analysis:** We need to select all `atom_id` values from the `connected` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `atom_id` FROM `connected`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (atom_ids that can bond with other atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `atom_id` FROM `connected`\n\n* **Main Question (elements of atoms that cannot bond):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `element` FROM `atom` WHERE `atom_id` NOT IN (SELECT `atom_id` FROM `connected`)\n\n**3.
