This requires joining the `attendance`, `event`, and `member` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`phone` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T3`.`event_id` WHERE `T3`.`event_name` = 'Women's Soccer'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (phone numbers of students):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`phone` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T3`.`event_id` WHERE `T3`.`event_name` = 'Women's Soccer'\n\n**3.
