This requires joining the `loan` table with the `account` table based on `account_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`district_id` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`date` = '1994-08-25'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the account associated with the loan.\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we will filter the `loan` table by the approval date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`date` = '1994-08-25'\n\n**2.
