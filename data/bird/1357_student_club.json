Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State the date Connor Hilton paid his/her dues.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `date_received` from the `income` table where the `source` is 'Dues' and the member's full name is 'Connor Hilton'. This requires joining the `member` table to filter by the member's first and last name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`date_received` FROM `income` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <source is Dues> AND <member is Connor Hilton>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** source is Dues\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `income` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`source` = 'Dues'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** member is Connor Hilton\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `member` table based on the first name and last name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`first_name` = 'Connor' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'Hilton'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (source is Dues):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`source` = 'Dues'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (member is Connor Hilton):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`first_name` = 'Connor' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'Hilton'\n\n* **Main Question (date received):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`date_received` FROM `income` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE `T1`.`source` = 'Dues' AND `T2`.`first_name` = 'Connor' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'Hilton'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `income` and `member` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
