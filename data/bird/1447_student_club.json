This requires joining the `event` table with the `budget` table based on the event ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name`, `T1`.`location` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE <remaining budget condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** remaining budget condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to include only those events where the remaining budget is greater than 0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`remaining` > 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (remaining budget condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`remaining` > 0\n\n* **Main Question (name and location of events):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name`, `T1`.`location` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE `T2`.`remaining` > 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `event` and `budget` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
