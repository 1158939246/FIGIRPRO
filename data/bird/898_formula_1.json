Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How old is the youngest Japanese driver? What is his name?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the name and age of the youngest driver from the `drivers` table who is Japanese. The age can be calculated using the `dob` column. We will filter by nationality and then order by `dob` to find the youngest.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, (YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(`T1`.`dob`)) AS `age` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE <nationality is Japanese> ORDER BY `T1`.`dob` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** nationality is Japanese\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `drivers` table using the `nationality` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`nationality` = 'Japanese'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (nationality is Japanese):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`nationality` = 'Japanese'\n\n* **Main Question (youngest Japanese driver):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, (YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(`T1`.`dob`)) AS `age` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`nationality` = 'Japanese' ORDER BY `T1`.`dob` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter for Japanese drivers and ordering by `dob` to find the youngest.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
