This involves two main steps: first, we need to identify the maximum loan amount, and then we need to find the corresponding account owner.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`client_id` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <largest loan amount>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** largest loan amount\n        * **Analysis:** We can find the maximum loan amount using the `MAX()` function on the `amount` column in the `loan` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `loan`)\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `loan` and `disp` tables based on the `account_id`, and we are filtering for the maximum loan amount directly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
