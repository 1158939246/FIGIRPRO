We also need to select the player's name or ID to identify who that player is.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE `height` = MAX(`height`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum height.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation on the `height` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`height`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum height):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`height`)\n\n* **Main Question (tallest player):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE `height` = (SELECT MAX(`height`) FROM `Player`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
