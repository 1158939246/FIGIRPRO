This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table to filter based on the power name from the `superpower` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <power_name = 'Intelligence'>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** power_name = 'Intelligence'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superpower` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`power_name` = 'Intelligence'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
