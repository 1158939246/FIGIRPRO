This requires filtering the `member` table based on the `zip` column, which references the `zip_code` table to determine the state.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE <hometown is in Maryland>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** hometown is in Maryland\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `zip_code` table using the `state` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`state` = 'Maryland'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (hometown is in Maryland):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`state` = 'Maryland'\n\n* **Main Question (count of members from Maryland):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T2`.`state` = 'Maryland'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `zip_code` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
