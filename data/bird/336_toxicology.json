We will need to join the `bond` and `molecule` tables to access the relevant information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`molecule_id`) FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <triple bond> AND <not carcinogenic>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** triple bond\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** not carcinogenic\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `molecule` table using the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n**2.
