Indicate the player's api id.\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the `player_api_id` of the player with the highest `overall_rating`. We will need to use the `MAX()` function to find the highest rating and then retrieve the corresponding `player_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_api_id` FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE `overall_rating` = <highest overall rating>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** highest overall rating\n        * **Analysis:** This requires us to find the maximum value of the `overall_rating` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`overall_rating`)\n\n**2.
