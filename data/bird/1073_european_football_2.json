This requires filtering based on the league name and the match date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Match AS T1 INNER JOIN League AS T2 ON T1.league_id = T2.id WHERE <matches in Germany 1. Bundesliga> AND <matches from August to October 2008>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** matches in Germany 1. Bundesliga  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `League` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** T2.name = 'Germany 1. Bundesliga'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** matches from August to October 2008  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Match` table based on the `date` column using the `strftime` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** strftime('%Y-%m', T1.date) BETWEEN '2008-08' AND '2008-10'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (matches in Germany 1. Bundesliga):**  \n    * **SQL:** T2.name = 'Germany 1. Bundesliga'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (matches from August to October 2008):**  \n    * **SQL:** strftime('%Y-%m', T1.date) BETWEEN '2008-08' AND '2008-10'\n\n* **Main Question (count of matches):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Match AS T1 INNER JOIN League AS T2 ON T1.league_id = T2.id WHERE T2.name = 'Germany 1. Bundesliga' AND strftime('%Y-%m', T1.date) BETWEEN '2008-08' AND '2008-10'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Match` and `League` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
