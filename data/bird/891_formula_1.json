Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name all drivers in the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix order by their position stands.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the names of drivers who participated in the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix and order them by their finishing position. This requires joining the `drivers`, `results`, and `races` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`forename` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE <race is the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix> ORDER BY `T2`.`position` ASC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race is the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to identify the raceId for the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix from the `races` table. This can be done by filtering on the year and name of the race.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`year` = 2010 AND `T3`.`name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race is the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`year` = 2010 AND `T3`.`name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix'\n\n* **Main Question (drivers in the race):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`forename` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T3`.`year` = 2010 AND `T3`.`name` = 'Singapore Grand Prix' ORDER BY `T2`.`position` ASC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filtered based on the race year and name. The ordering is applied directly to the results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
