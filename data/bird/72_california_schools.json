Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many students from the ages of 5 to 17 are enrolled at the State Special School school in Fremont for the 2014-2015 academic year?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of students enrolled, which is represented by the `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` column in the `frpm` table. We will filter based on the `EdOpsCode`, the `District Name`, and the `Academic Year`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) FROM `frpm` WHERE <State Special School> AND <District Name is Fremont> AND <Academic Year is 2014-2015>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** State Special School\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `frpm` table using the `EdOpsCode` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `EdOpsCode` = 'SSS'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** District Name is Fremont\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `frpm` table based on the `District Name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `District Name` = 'Fremont'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Academic Year is 2014-2015\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `frpm` table based on the `Academic Year` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Academic Year` = '2014-2015'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (State Special School):**\n    * **SQL:** `EdOpsCode` = 'SSS'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (District Name is Fremont):**\n    * **SQL:** `District Name` = 'Fremont'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (Academic Year is 2014-2015):**\n    * **SQL:** `Academic Year` = '2014-2015'\n\n* **Main Question (count of students):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) FROM `frpm` WHERE `EdOpsCode` = 'SSS' AND `District Name` = 'Fremont' AND `Academic Year` = '2014-2015'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with `SUM()` to aggregate the enrollment numbers based on the specified filters.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
