Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the ratio of customers who pay in EUR against customers who pay in CZK?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate a ratio based on the counts of customers paying in different currencies. We will need to count the number of customers for each currency and then compute the ratio.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'CZK' THEN 1 END) FROM customers\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of customers who pay in EUR\n        * **Analysis:** This can be achieved using a conditional count on the `Currency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of customers who pay in CZK\n        * **Analysis:** Similarly, we will count the customers who pay in CZK.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'CZK' THEN 1 END)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Count of customers who pay in EUR):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Count of customers who pay in CZK):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'CZK' THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Main Question (Ratio of customers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'EUR' THEN 1 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(CASE WHEN Currency = 'CZK' THEN 1 END) FROM customers\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using conditional counting to derive the counts for each currency in a single query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
