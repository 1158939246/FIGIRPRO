The relevant columns are in the `satscores` and `schools` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`School` FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE <SAT test takers > 500> AND <Magnet = 1>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** SAT test takers > 500\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `NumTstTakr` column in the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`NumTstTakr` > 500\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Magnet = 1\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `Magnet` column in the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Magnet` = 1\n\n**2.
