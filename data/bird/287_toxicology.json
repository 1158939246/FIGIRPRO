This involves counting the total number of bonds and the number of double-bonds for the molecule with ID 'TR047'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(<double bond condition>), COUNT(<all bonds condition>)) AS percent FROM `bond` WHERE <molecule_id = 'TR047'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** double bond condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the bond type is a double bond.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `bond_type = ' = '`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** all bonds condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition counts all bonds for the specified molecule.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `bond_id IS NOT NULL`\n\n**2.
