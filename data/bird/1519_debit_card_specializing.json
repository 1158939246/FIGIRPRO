Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the product id of the transaction happened at 2012/8/23 21:20:00?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `ProductID` from the `transactions_1k` table where the `Date` is '2012-08-23' and the `Time` is '21:20:00'.  \n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ProductID` FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE <transaction date> AND <transaction time>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** transaction date  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Date` column.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Date` = '2012-08-23'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** transaction time  \n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `Time` column.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Time` = '21:20:00'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (transaction date):**  \n    * **SQL:** `Date` = '2012-08-23'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (transaction time):**  \n    * **SQL:** `Time` = '21:20:00'\n\n* **Main Question (product id of the transaction):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `ProductID` FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `Date` = '2012-08-23' AND `Time` = '21:20:00'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient and straightforward. It directly retrieves the `ProductID` based on the specified date and time without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
