Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the disease names of the patients that have a proteinuria level higher than normal.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `Diagnosis` from the `Patient` table for patients whose `U-PRO` level in the `Laboratory` table is greater than or equal to 30. This requires a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <proteinuria level higher than normal>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** proteinuria level higher than normal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `U-PRO` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`U-PRO` >= 30\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (proteinuria level higher than normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`U-PRO` >= 30\n\n* **Main Question (disease names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`U-PRO` >= 30\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
