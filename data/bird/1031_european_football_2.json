Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** At present, calculate for the player's age who have a sprint speed of no less than 97 between 2013 to 2015.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the age of players based on their birthday and filter them based on their sprint speed and the date range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUBTRACT(DATETIME(), `birthday`) AS `age` FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `PA`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE <sprint speed condition> AND <date condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** sprint speed condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter players based on their sprint speed.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `PA`.`sprint_speed` >= 97\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the records based on the date range from 2013 to 2015. Since the `date` column is in the `Player_Attributes` table, we will filter based on that.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `YEAR(PA`.`date`) >= 2013 AND YEAR(PA`.`date`) <= 2015\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (sprint speed condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `PA`.`sprint_speed` >= 97\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `YEAR(PA`.`date`) >= 2013 AND YEAR(PA`.`date`) <= 2015\n\n* **Main Question (calculate age):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUBTRACT(DATETIME(), `P`.`birthday`) AS `age` FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `PA`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE `PA`.`sprint_speed` >= 97 AND YEAR(PA`.`date`) >= 2013 AND YEAR(PA`.`date`) <= 2015\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
