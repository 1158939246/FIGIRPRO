This involves filtering based on gender, region, and average salary. The relevant tables are `client` for gender and `district` for region and average salary.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <male customers> AND <living in North Bohemia> AND <average salary greater than 8000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male customers\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `client` table using the `gender` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`gender` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** living in North Bohemia\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `district` table based on the `A3` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A3` = 'north Bohemia'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** average salary greater than 8000\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `district` table based on the `A11` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A11` > 8000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male customers):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`gender` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (living in North Bohemia):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`A3` = 'north Bohemia'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (average salary greater than 8000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`A11` > 8000\n\n* **Main Question (count of male customers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`gender` = 'M' AND `T2`.`A3` = 'north Bohemia' AND `T2`.`A11` > 8000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
