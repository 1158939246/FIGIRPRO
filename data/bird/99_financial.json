Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the accounts who have loan validity more than 12 months, list out the accounts that have the highest approved amount and have account opening date in 1993.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter accounts based on loan duration, approved amount, and account opening date. The `loan` table contains the `duration` and `amount`, while the `account` table contains the `date`. We will need to join these tables to get the required information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <loan validity more than 12 months> AND <highest approved amount> AND <account opening date in 1993>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** loan validity more than 12 months\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `loan` table using the `duration` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`duration` > 12\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** account opening date in 1993\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `account` table based on the `date` column. We will extract the year from the date and check if it equals 1993.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '1993'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** highest approved amount\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum approved amount from the `loan` table. This requires using the `MAX()` function after filtering the loans based on the previous conditions.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`T1`.`amount`) FROM `loan` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`duration` > 12)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (loan validity more than 12 months):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`duration` > 12\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (account opening date in 1993):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '1993'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (highest approved amount):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`T1`.`amount`) FROM `loan` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`duration` > 12)\n\n* **Main Question (accounts with highest approved amount):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`duration` > 12 AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '1993' AND `T1`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`T1`.`amount`) FROM `loan` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`duration` > 12)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
