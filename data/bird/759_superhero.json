Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the eye colour of the heaviest superhero?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the eye colour of the superhero with the maximum weight. This requires us to first identify the heaviest superhero using the `weight_kg` column and then retrieve the corresponding `eye_colour_id` to find the eye colour from the `colour` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` = (SELECT MAX(`weight_kg`) FROM `superhero`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the heaviest superhero\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation to find the maximum weight from the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`weight_kg`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (heaviest superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`weight_kg`)\n\n* **Main Question (eye colour of the heaviest superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` = (SELECT MAX(`weight_kg`) FROM `superhero`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `superhero` and `colour` tables based on the `eye_colour_id`, and we are filtering for the superhero with the maximum weight.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
