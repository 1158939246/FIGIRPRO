Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For loans contracts which are still running where client are in debt, list the district and the state the percentage unemployment rate increment from year 1995 to 1996.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the districts where the loans are in status 'D' and calculate the unemployment increment rate from 1995 to 1996. This requires joining the `loan`, `account`, and `district` tables to filter the loans and retrieve the unemployment rates from the `district` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `district`.`A3`, ((`district`.`A13` - `district`.`A12`) / `district`.`A12`) * 100 AS `unemployment_increment` FROM `loan` AS `L` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `L`.`account_id` = `A`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `district` AS `D` ON `A`.`district_id` = `D`.`district_id` WHERE `L`.`status` = 'D'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for loans that are still running and in debt\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `loan` table using the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`status` = 'D'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Retrieve the unemployment rates for 1995 and 1996\n        * **Analysis:** This will be done by selecting the columns `A12` and `A13` from the `district` table, which represent the unemployment rates for 1995 and 1996 respectively.\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter for loans in debt):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`status` = 'D'\n\n* **Main Question (calculate unemployment increment):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `D`.`A3`, ((`D`.`A13` - `D`.`A12`) / `D`.`A12`) * 100 AS `unemployment_increment` FROM `loan` AS `L` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `L`.`account_id` = `A`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `district` AS `D` ON `A`.`district_id` = `D`.`district_id` WHERE `L`.`status` = 'D'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
