Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the disease name of the patient who has the highest level of triglyceride within the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `Diagnosis` of the patient with the maximum `TG` value that is less than 200. This requires joining the `Laboratory` table (for `TG`) with the `Patient` table (for `Diagnosis`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`TG` = (SELECT MAX(`TG`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `TG` < 200)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest level of triglyceride within the normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This involves finding the maximum `TG` value from the `Laboratory` table where `TG` is less than 200.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`TG`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `TG` < 200\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest level of triglyceride within the normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT MAX(`TG`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `TG` < 200)\n\n* **Main Question (disease name of the patient):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`TG` = (SELECT MAX(`TG`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `TG` < 200)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
