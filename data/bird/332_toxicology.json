We will need to filter the `bond` table for single bonds and then check the corresponding `molecule_id` values to see if they fall within the specified range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `molecule_id`) FROM `bond` WHERE <single bond> AND <molecule_id between TR004 and TR010>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** single bond\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `bond_type` = '-'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** molecule_id between TR004 and TR010\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `molecule_id` column in the `bond` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `molecule_id` BETWEEN 'TR004' AND 'TR010'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to ensure we only count unique molecules that meet the criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
