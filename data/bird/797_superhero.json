Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which superheroes have blue eyes with brown hair?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table where the `eye_colour_id` corresponds to blue and the `hair_colour_id` corresponds to brown. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `colour` table twice: once for the eye color and once for the hair color.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <blue eyes> AND <brown hair>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** blue eyes  \n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the color is blue in the `colour` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** brown hair  \n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the color is brown in the `colour` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`colour` = 'Brown'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (blue eyes):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (brown hair):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`colour` = 'Brown'\n\n* **Main Question (superheroes with blue eyes and brown hair):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue' AND `T3`.`colour` = 'Brown'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` table with the `colour` table for both eye and hair colors, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
