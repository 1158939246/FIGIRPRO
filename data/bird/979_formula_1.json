We will group by `raceId` and then find the race with the maximum count of finishers.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` WHERE <time is not null> GROUP BY `raceId` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** time is not null\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `results` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (time is not null):**\n    * **SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (race with the most finishers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` WHERE `time` IS NOT NULL GROUP BY `raceId` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `GROUP BY` to aggregate the results by `raceId` and `ORDER BY` to sort them by the count of finishers in descending order, limiting the result to the top entry.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
