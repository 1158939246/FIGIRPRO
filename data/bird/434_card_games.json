Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many sets are available just in Japanese and not in Magic: The Gathering Online? \n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of sets that meet two criteria: they are available in Japanese and they are not available in Magic: The Gathering Online. We will use the `sets` and `set_translations` tables to gather this information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <available in Japanese> AND <not in Magic: The Gathering Online>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** available in Japanese\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `set_translations` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Japanese'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** not in Magic: The Gathering Online\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied to the `sets` table using the `mtgoCode` column, checking for NULL or empty values.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`mtgoCode` IS NULL OR `T1`.`mtgoCode` = ''\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (available in Japanese):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Japanese'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (not in Magic: The Gathering Online):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`mtgoCode` IS NULL OR `T1`.`mtgoCode` = ''\n\n* **Main Question (count of sets):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`language` = 'Japanese' AND (`T1`.`mtgoCode` IS NULL OR `T1`.`mtgoCode` = '')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `sets` and `set_translations` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
