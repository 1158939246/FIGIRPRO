Also give the school's name.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the school with the lowest average score in reading from the `satscores` table and then retrieve the corresponding mailing street address from the `schools` table. This requires a join between the two tables based on the `cds` (which is the primary key in `satscores` and a foreign key in `schools`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`MailStreet`, `T2`.`School` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <lowest average score in reading>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** lowest average score in reading\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the minimum value of `AvgScrRead` from the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`AvgScrRead` = (SELECT MIN(`AvgScrRead`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (lowest average score in reading):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`AvgScrRead` = (SELECT MIN(`AvgScrRead`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n* **Main Question (mailing street address and school name):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`MailStreet`, `T2`.`School` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`AvgScrRead` = (SELECT MIN(`AvgScrRead`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the two tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the lowest average score in reading.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
