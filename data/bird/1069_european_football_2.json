We will also need to select the player's name to identify who it is.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE `height` = <shortest height>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** shortest height\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward calculation using the `MIN()` function on the `height` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MIN(`height`)\n\n**2.
