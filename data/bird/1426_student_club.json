This requires joining the `member` table with the `major` table based on the `link_to_major` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`department`, `T2`.`college` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE <major is Environmental Engineering>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** major is Environmental Engineering\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `major` table using the `major_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`major_name` = 'Environmental Engineering'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (major is Environmental Engineering):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`major_name` = 'Environmental Engineering'\n\n* **Main Question (last name of members with major):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`department`, `T2`.`college` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`major_name` = 'Environmental Engineering'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
