Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all patients who are older than 55 years old, what is the percentage of female who has abnormal prothrombin time (PT)?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of female patients with abnormal PT among all patients with abnormal PT who are older than 55 years. This involves filtering by age and PT, and then performing a calculation for the percentage.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(<female patients with abnormal PT>) / SUM(<all patients with abnormal PT>)) * 100 AS percentage FROM <patients> WHERE <older than 55> AND <abnormal PT>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** older than 55\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be derived from the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table. We will use the current date to calculate the age.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', Birthday) > 55\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** abnormal PT\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be derived from the `PT` column in the `Laboratory` table. We will filter for PT values greater than or equal to 14.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** PT >= 14\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** female patients with abnormal PT\n        * **Analysis:** This will involve filtering the results from the previous conditions to count only female patients.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SEX = 'F'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (older than 55):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', Birthday) > 55\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (abnormal PT):**\n    * **SQL:** PT >= 14\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (female patients with abnormal PT):**\n    * **SQL:** SEX = 'F'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN SEX = 'F' AND PT >= 14 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / SUM(CASE WHEN PT >= 14 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS percentage \n      FROM Patient AS P \n      INNER JOIN Laboratory AS L ON P.ID = L.ID \n      WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', P.Birthday) > 55 AND L.PT >= 14;\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
