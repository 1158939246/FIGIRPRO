Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients whose creatinine level is abnormal, how many of them aren't 70 yet?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients with an abnormal creatinine level (CRE >= 1.5) and who are younger than 70 years old. This requires filtering based on the `CRE` column in the `Laboratory` table and the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal creatinine level> AND <younger than 70>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal creatinine level\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `CRE` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`CRE` >= 1.5\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** younger than 70\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the age of the patients based on their `Birthday` and compare it to 70. We can use the `strftime` function to extract the year from the `Birthday` and compare it to the current year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', `P`.`Birthday`)) < 70\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal creatinine level):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`CRE` >= 1.5\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (younger than 70):**\n    * **SQL:** (strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', `P`.`Birthday`)) < 70\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`CRE` >= 1.5 AND (strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', `P`.`Birthday`)) < 70\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
