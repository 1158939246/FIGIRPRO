Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which district has the highest active loan?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the district with the highest total amount of active loans. Active loans are defined by the status 'C' or 'D'. We will need to join the `loan` table with the `account` table to access the district information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `A3` FROM `district` AS `D` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `D`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `loan` AS `L` ON `A`.`account_id` = `L`.`account_id` WHERE <active loan> GROUP BY `A3` ORDER BY <total loan amount> DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** active loan\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `loan` table for loans with status 'C' or 'D'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`status` IN ('C', 'D')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** total loan amount\n        * **Analysis:** We will sum the `amount` from the `loan` table for each district.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`L`.`amount`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (active loan):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`status` IN ('C', 'D')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total loan amount):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`L`.`amount`)\n\n* **Main Question (district with highest active loan):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `D`.`A3` FROM `district` AS `D` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `D`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `loan` AS `L` ON `A`.`account_id` = `L`.`account_id` WHERE `L`.`status` IN ('C', 'D') GROUP BY `D`.`A3` ORDER BY SUM(`L`.`amount`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to get the district with the highest total loan amount.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
