Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum FavoriteCount for posts voted by user 1465):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T2`.`FavoriteCount`) FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`UserId` = 1465\n\n* **Main Question (id of the most valuable post):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`FavoriteCount` = (SELECT MAX(`T2`.`FavoriteCount`) FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`UserId` = 1465)\n\n**3.
