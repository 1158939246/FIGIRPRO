Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the percentage of the customers who used EUR in 2012/8/25?\n    * **Analysis:** To find the percentage of customers who used EUR on a specific date, we need to determine two counts: the total number of customers and the number of customers who used EUR on that date. The percentage can then be calculated as (count of EUR customers / total customers) * 100.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(EUR_Customers) * 100.0 / COUNT(Total_Customers)) AS Percentage FROM (SELECT <Total_Customers>, <EUR_Customers>)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Total_Customers\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count all distinct customers from the `customers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) FROM customers\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** EUR_Customers\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct customers who used EUR on the date '2012-08-25'. This requires joining the `customers`, `transactions_1k`, and `yearmonth` tables to filter by date and currency.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.CustomerID) FROM customers AS C INNER JOIN transactions_1k AS T ON C.CustomerID = T.CustomerID INNER JOIN yearmonth AS Y ON C.CustomerID = Y.CustomerID WHERE C.Currency = 'EUR' AND T.Date = '2012-08-25'\n\n**2.
