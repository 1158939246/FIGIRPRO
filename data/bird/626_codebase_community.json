We need to filter these votes based on the year of the `CreationDate`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`Id`) FROM `votes` WHERE <votes made in 2010>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** votes made in 2010\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `votes` table directly based on the `CreationDate` column using the `YEAR()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`CreationDate`) = 2010\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (votes made in 2010):**\n    * **SQL:** YEAR(`CreationDate`) = 2010\n\n* **Main Question (count of votes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`Id`) FROM `votes` WHERE YEAR(`CreationDate`) = 2010\n\n**3.
