The `account` table contains the issuance type, and the `district` table contains the region information. We will need to join these tables based on `district_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <issuance after transaction> AND <East Bohemia region>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** issuance after transaction\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `account` table using the `frequency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** East Bohemia region\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `district` table using the `A3` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A3` = 'east Bohemia'\n\n**2.
