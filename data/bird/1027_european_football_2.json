We will use `ORDER BY` to sort the players by their penalties in descending order and limit the results to the top 10.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` ORDER BY `T2`.`penalties` DESC LIMIT 10\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (top 10 players with highest penalties):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` ORDER BY `T2`.`penalties` DESC LIMIT 10\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the `player_api_id`, and we are ordering the results by the `penalties` column in descending order.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
