This requires a join between the `budget` and `event` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`category`, `T1`.`amount` FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'January Speaker'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** category and amount for the event\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we will select the `category` and `amount` columns from the `budget` table after filtering by the event name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`category`, `T1`.`amount`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** filtering by event name\n        * **Analysis:** We will filter the results based on the `event_name` column in the `event` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'January Speaker'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (category and amount for the event):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`category`, `T1`.`amount`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (filtering by event name):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'January Speaker'\n\n* **Main Question (final SQL):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`category`, `T1`.`amount` FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'January Speaker'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `budget` and `event` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
