We will also need to join the `account` table to get the `district_id`, and then join the `district` table to get the district and region names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id`, `T2`.`A2`, `T2`.`A3` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T3`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <loan amount > 300000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** loan amount > 300000\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `loan` table using the `amount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`amount` > 300000\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
