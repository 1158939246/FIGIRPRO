This information is stored in the `member` table, and we will also need to join it with the `zip_code` table to get the `state`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`state` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sacha' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Harrison'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the member with the name \"Sacha Harrison\".\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `member` table based on the `first_name` and `last_name`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sacha' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Harrison'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify the member):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sacha' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Harrison'\n\n* **Main Question (hometown state):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`state` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T1`.`first_name` = 'Sacha' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Harrison'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `zip_code` tables based on the relationship between the `zip` and `zip_code` columns. The filtering criteria are clearly defined.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
