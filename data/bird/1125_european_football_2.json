Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the players with finishing rate of 1, pick the eldest player and state the player's name.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the player's name who has the maximum age among those with a finishing rate of 1. The age can be calculated using the `birthday` column, and we will filter players based on the `finishing` attribute.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE <finishing rate = 1> ORDER BY <age> DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** finishing rate = 1\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `finishing` column from the `Player_Attributes` table. We will need to join the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `finishing` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age calculation\n        * **Analysis:** To find the eldest player, we will calculate the age using the `birthday` column. The age can be derived from the difference between the current date and the birthday.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(SUBTRACT(datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'localtime'), datetime(birthday)))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (finishing rate = 1):**\n    * **SQL:** `Player_Attributes`.`finishing` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(SUBTRACT(datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'localtime'), datetime(birthday)))\n\n* **Main Question (eldest player's name):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `P`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `PA`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE `PA`.`finishing` = 1 ORDER BY datetime(P.birthday) ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `ORDER BY` clause is used to find the eldest player.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
