This requires joining the `superhero`, `gender`, and `hero_power` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`id` = `T3`.`hero_id` WHERE <male superheroes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male superheroes\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `gender` table using the `gender` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`gender` = 'Male'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`gender` = 'Male'\n\n* **Main Question (list of superpowers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`id` = `T3`.`hero_id` WHERE `T2`.`gender` = 'Male'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
