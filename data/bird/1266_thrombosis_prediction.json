Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum `Birthday` for patients with an abnormal `RNP` level. The `Birthday` is in the `Patient` table, and the `RNP` level is in the `Laboratory` table. We will need to join these tables based on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`Birthday`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `RNP` column in the `Laboratory` table. We need to ensure that `RNP` is not equal to `'-'` or `'+-'`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RNP` NOT IN ('-', '+-')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RNP` NOT IN ('-', '+-')\n\n* **Main Question (youngest patient):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`Birthday`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`RNP` NOT IN ('-', '+-')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
