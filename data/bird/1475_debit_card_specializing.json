Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many customers in KAM had a consumption of less than 30,000 for the year 2012?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the customers who belong to the KAM segment and have a total consumption less than 30,000 for the year 2012. This requires joining the `customers`, `yearmonth`, and filtering based on the segment and consumption.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `C`.`CustomerID`) FROM `customers` AS `C` INNER JOIN `yearmonth` AS `Y` ON `C`.`CustomerID` = `Y`.`CustomerID` WHERE <KAM segment> AND <consumption less than 30,000> AND <year 2012>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** KAM segment\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `C`.`Segment` = 'KAM'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** consumption less than 30,000\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `yearmonth` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Y`.`Consumption` < 30000\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** year 2012\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `yearmonth` table for dates between 201201 and 201212.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Y`.`Date` BETWEEN '201201' AND '201212'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (KAM segment):**\n    * **SQL:** `C`.`Segment` = 'KAM'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (consumption less than 30,000):**\n    * **SQL:** `Y`.`Consumption` < 30000\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (year 2012):**\n    * **SQL:** `Y`.`Date` BETWEEN '201201' AND '201212'\n\n* **Main Question (count of customers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `C`.`CustomerID`) FROM `customers` AS `C` INNER JOIN `yearmonth` AS `Y` ON `C`.`CustomerID` = `Y`.`CustomerID` WHERE `C`.`Segment` = 'KAM' AND `Y`.`Consumption` < 30000 AND `Y`.`Date` BETWEEN '201201' AND '201212'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
