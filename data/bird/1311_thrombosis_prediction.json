The relevant data is in the `Examination` table for thrombosis and in the `Laboratory` table for prothrombin time.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `E`.`ID`) FROM `Examination` AS `E` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `E`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <severe thrombosis> AND <normal prothrombin time>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** severe thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table where we check if `Thrombosis` is either 1 or 2.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`Thrombosis` IN (1, 2)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal prothrombin time\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table to check if `PT` is less than 14.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`PT` < 14\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (severe thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`Thrombosis` IN (1, 2)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal prothrombin time):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`PT` < 14\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `E`.`ID`) FROM `Examination` AS `E` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `E`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `E`.`Thrombosis` IN (1, 2) AND `L`.`PT` < 14\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
