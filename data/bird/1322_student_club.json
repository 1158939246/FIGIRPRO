Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the events attended by more than 10 members of the Student_Club, how many of them are meetings?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of events that are of type 'Meeting' and have more than 10 members attending. This requires us to join the `attendance` and `event` tables, group by the event, and apply the necessary filters.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE <event is a meeting> GROUP BY `T1`.`event_id` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_member`) > 10\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event is a meeting\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'Meeting'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (event is a meeting):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'Meeting'\n\n* **Main Question (count of meetings with more than 10 members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE `T1`.`type` = 'Meeting' GROUP BY `T1`.`event_id` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_member`) > 10\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for counting events attended by more than 10 members.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
