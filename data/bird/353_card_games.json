Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all the sets available in Italian translation. State the total number of cards per set.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the set information along with the total number of cards for each set that has an Italian translation. This involves joining the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table based on the `setCode`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`totalSetSize` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <Italian translation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Italian translation\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `set_translations` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Italian translation):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian'\n\n* **Main Question (sets with Italian translation and total cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`totalSetSize` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`language` = 'Italian'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
