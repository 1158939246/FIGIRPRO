This requires joining the `set_translations` table with the `sets` table to filter by the set name and language.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `translation` FROM `set_translations` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE <language is Chinese Simplified> AND <set name is Mirrodin>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** language is Chinese Simplified  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `set_translations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** set name is Mirrodin  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Mirrodin'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
