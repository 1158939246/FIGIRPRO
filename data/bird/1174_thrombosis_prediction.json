Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average age of patients as of year 1999 examined in the laboratory for the October of the year 1991?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average age of patients as of 1999, which involves the `Birthday` column from the `Patient` table. We also need to filter the laboratory examinations that occurred in October 1991, which involves the `Date` column from the `Laboratory` table. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(1999 - STRFTIME('%Y', `Birthday`)) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`Date` BETWEEN '1991-10-01' AND '1991-10-30'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for October of the year 1991\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied directly in the `WHERE` clause of the main query.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`Date` BETWEEN '1991-10-01' AND '1991-10-30'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (October of the year 1991):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`Date` BETWEEN '1991-10-01' AND '1991-10-30'\n\n* **Main Question (average age calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(1999 - STRFTIME('%Y', `Birthday`)) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`Date` BETWEEN '1991-10-01' AND '1991-10-30'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
