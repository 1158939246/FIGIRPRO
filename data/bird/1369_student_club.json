We will need to join the `event` and `budget` tables to access both the event name and the budget amount. The highest budget amount can be obtained using the `MAX()` function.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE <highest budget amount>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest budget amount\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum budget amount from the `budget` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `budget`)\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `event` and `budget` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the maximum budget amount.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
