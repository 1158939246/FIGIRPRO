Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the players who had a 77 points overall rating on 2016/6/23, who was the oldest? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the name of the player with the oldest birthday among those who have an overall rating of 77 and whose attributes were recorded on the specified date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_api_id` = `PA`.`player_api_id` WHERE <overall rating is 77> AND <date is 2016/6/23> ORDER BY <birthday> ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** overall rating is 77\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player_Attributes` table using the `overall_rating` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `PA`.`overall_rating` = 77\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date is 2016/6/23\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `Player_Attributes` table using the `date` column and the `LIKE` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `PA`.`date` LIKE '2016-06-23%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Order by birthday to find the oldest\n        * **Analysis:** To find the oldest player, we will order by the `birthday` column in the `Player` table in ascending order.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `P`.`birthday` ASC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (overall rating is 77):**\n    * **SQL:** `PA`.`overall_rating` = 77\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date is 2016/6/23):**\n    * **SQL:** `PA`.`date` LIKE '2016-06-23%'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (order by birthday):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `P`.`birthday` ASC\n\n* **Main Question (oldest player):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `P`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_api_id` = `PA`.`player_api_id` WHERE `PA`.`overall_rating` = 77 AND `PA`.`date` LIKE '2016-06-23%' ORDER BY `P`.`birthday` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The ordering and limiting are also correctly applied to find the oldest player.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
