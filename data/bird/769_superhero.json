Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which superhero has the most durability published by Dark Horse Comics?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the superhero's name with the maximum durability score. This involves joining the `superhero`, `hero_attribute`, `attribute`, and `publisher` tables to filter by the publisher and attribute type.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `hero_attribute` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`id` = `T1`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `attribute` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`attribute_id` = `T3`.`id` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T4` ON `T2`.`publisher_id` = `T4`.`id` WHERE `T3`.`attribute_name` = 'durability' AND `T4`.`publisher_name` = 'Dark Horse Comics' ORDER BY `T1`.`attribute_value` DESC LIMIT 1;\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** most durability\n        * **Analysis:** This is achieved by using the `MAX()` function on the `attribute_value` column from the `hero_attribute` table, but we need to ensure we join the tables correctly first.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`T1`.`attribute_value`) WHERE `T3`.`attribute_name` = 'durability'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** published by Dark Horse Comics\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `publisher` table to ensure we only consider superheroes published by 'Dark Horse Comics'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T4`.`publisher_name` = 'Dark Horse Comics'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (most durability):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`T1`.`attribute_value`) WHERE `T3`.`attribute_name` = 'durability'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (published by Dark Horse Comics):**\n    * **SQL:** `T4`.`publisher_name` = 'Dark Horse Comics'\n\n* **Main Question (superhero with most durability):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `hero_attribute` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`id` = `T1`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `attribute` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`attribute_id` = `T3`.`id` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T4` ON `T2`.`publisher_id` = `T4`.`id` WHERE `T3`.`attribute_name` = 'durability' AND `T4`.`publisher_name` = 'Dark Horse Comics' ORDER BY `T1`.`attribute_value` DESC LIMIT 1;\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filters the results based on the required conditions. The use of `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT 1` effectively retrieves the superhero with the highest durability.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
