This requires filtering the `Examination` table for the RF condition and the `Patient` table for the Thrombosis condition.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal RF> AND <no thrombosis>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal RF\n        * **Analysis:** This condition is based on the `RF` column in the `Examination` table, where we need to check if `RF < 20`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RF` < 20\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** no thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This condition is based on the `Thrombosis` column in the `Examination` table, where we need to check if `Thrombosis = 0`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal RF):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RF` < 20\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (no thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`RF` < 20 AND `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
