Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the fastest lap speed among all drivers in the 2009 Spanish Grand Prix?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of `fastestLapSpeed` from the `results` table, but only for the races that match the 2009 Spanish Grand Prix. This requires joining the `results` table with the `races` table to filter by the race name and year.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE <Spanish Grand Prix> AND <year = 2009>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Spanish Grand Prix  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `races` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Spanish Grand Prix'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** year = 2009  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `year` column in the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`year` = 2009\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Spanish Grand Prix):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Spanish Grand Prix'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (year = 2009):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`year` = 2009\n\n* **Main Question (fastest lap speed):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Spanish Grand Prix' AND `T2`.`year` = 2009\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
