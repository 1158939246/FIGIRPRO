This requires joining the `posts` and `postHistory` tables based on the post ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Id`, COUNT(`T2`.`Id`) AS `PostHistoryCount`, `T1`.`LastEditDate` FROM `posts` AS `T1` LEFT JOIN `postHistory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` WHERE `T1`.`Title` = 'What is the best introductory Bayesian statistics textbook?'

GROUP BY `T1`.`Id`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.

The `GROUP BY` clause is necessary to aggregate the post history counts.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
