This requires joining the `trans` table with the `account` table to filter by `district_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT * FROM `trans` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` = 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter by district 5\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `account` table using the `district_id` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`district_id` = 5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter by district 5):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`district_id` = 5\n\n* **Main Question (list all transactions):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT * FROM `trans` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` = 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `trans` and `account` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
