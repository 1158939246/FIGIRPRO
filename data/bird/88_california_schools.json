Provide the name of the school.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the administrator's email address for the school with the highest number of test takers who received SAT scores of at least 1500? Provide the name of the school.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the school with the highest number of test takers whose SAT scores are at least 1500. This involves filtering the `satscores` table for scores of at least 1500, counting the number of test takers, and then joining with the `schools` table to get the administrator's email address and the school name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`AdmEmail1`, `T2`.`School` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <SAT scores >= 1500> ORDER BY <number of test takers> DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** SAT scores >= 1500\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `AvgScrMath`, `AvgScrRead`, and `AvgScrWrite` columns in the `satscores` table. We will check if any of these scores are at least 1500.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`NumGE1500` > 0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of test takers\n        * **Analysis:** We need to order the results by the number of test takers (`NumTstTakr`) in descending order to find the school with the highest number of test takers.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`NumTstTakr` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (SAT scores >= 1500):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`NumGE1500` > 0\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of test takers):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`NumTstTakr` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (administrator's email and school name):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`AdmEmail1`, `T2`.`School` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`NumGE1500` > 0 ORDER BY `T1`.`NumTstTakr` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures we get the school with the highest number of test takers.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
