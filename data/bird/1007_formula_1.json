We will need to join the `pitStops` table with the `drivers` table to filter for Lewis Hamilton's pit stops.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`duration`) FROM `pitStops` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <Lewis Hamilton>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Lewis Hamilton\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to only include those for Lewis Hamilton.
