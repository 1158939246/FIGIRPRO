Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the football team that has a build up play speed of 31, build up play dribbling of 53, and build up play passing of 32.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `team_short_name` from the `Team` table, but first, we need to join it with the `Team_Attributes` table to filter based on the specified attributes.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE <build up play speed> AND <build up play dribbling> AND <build up play passing>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** build up play speed\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeed` = 31\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** build up play dribbling\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlayDribbling` = 53\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** build up play passing\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` = 32\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (build up play speed):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeed` = 31\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (build up play dribbling):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlayDribbling` = 53\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (build up play passing):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` = 32\n\n* **Main Question (team short name):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeed` = 31 AND `T2`.`buildUpPlayDribbling` = 53 AND `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` = 32\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
