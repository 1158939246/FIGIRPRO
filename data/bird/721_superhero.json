We need to filter the superheroes based on the `eye_colour_id` that corresponds to the color 'Blue' in the `colour` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE <eye color is blue>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** eye color is blue  \n        * **Analysis:** To determine which superheroes have blue eyes, we need to join the `superhero` table with the `colour` table on `eye_colour_id` and filter for the color 'Blue'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Blue')\n\n**2.
