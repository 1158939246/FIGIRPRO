The question specifically asks for the postal street address, which is synonymous with mailing street according to the hint provided. Therefore, we need to access the 'schools' table, which contains the 'MailStreet' column that provides the postal street address. Additionally, we need to determine the Math average rankings, which would typically be found in a table that includes student scores or averages, but since the schema does not explicitly provide a table for Math scores, we can infer that the 'satscores' table might contain relevant data for average scores, as it relates to school performance.
