Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which county reported the most number of school closures in the 1980s with school ownership code belonging to Youth Authority Facilities (CEA)?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of school closures per county for schools that have a SOC of 11 and were closed between 1980 and 1989. The `schools` table contains the `SOC` and `ClosedDate`, while the `satscores` table contains the `County`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `County`, COUNT(*) FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <SOC = 11> AND <ClosedDate between 1980 and 1989> GROUP BY `County` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** SOC = 11\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SOC` = 11\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ClosedDate between 1980 and 1989\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `ClosedDate` column to include only those dates within the specified range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`ClosedDate` BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (SOC = 11):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SOC` = 11\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ClosedDate between 1980 and 1989):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`ClosedDate` BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (count of closures per county):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`County`, COUNT(*) FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`SOC` = 11 AND `T1`.`ClosedDate` BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31' GROUP BY `T2`.`County` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to get the county with the most closures.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
