The relevant tables are `cards` and `foreign_data`, which we will join on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`uuid`, `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <availability is paper> AND <language is Japanese>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** availability is paper\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `availability` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`availability` = 'paper'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** language is Japanese\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `foreign_data` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Japanese'\n\n**2.
