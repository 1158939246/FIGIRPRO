We will filter the results to include only those players whose preferred foot is 'left'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT * FROM `Player` WHERE <preferred foot is left>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** preferred foot is left\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `preferred_foot` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `preferred_foot` = 'left'\n\n**2.
