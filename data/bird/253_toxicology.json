To get the elements, we will need to join the `bond` table with the `connected` table to find the atoms involved in these bonds, and then join with the `atom` table to get the corresponding elements.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`element` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`atom_id` = `T3`.`atom_id` WHERE <bond_type is triple>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bond_type is triple\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bond_type is triple):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n* **Main Question (elements of all triple bonds):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T3`.`element` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`atom_id` = `T3`.`atom_id` WHERE `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
