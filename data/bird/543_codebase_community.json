Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the post that got the most number of answers owned by csgillespie, how many answers did it get?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the post owned by the user \"csgillespie\" and then determine the maximum number of answers that post received. This involves joining the `posts` table with the `users` table to filter by the owner's display name and then using the `MAX()` function on the `AnswerCount`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`AnswerCount`) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`DisplayName` = 'csgillespie'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (max answer count for the post):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`AnswerCount`) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`DisplayName` = 'csgillespie'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `posts` and `users` tables based on the relationship between the post owner and the user display name. The `MAX()` function is applied directly after the join.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
