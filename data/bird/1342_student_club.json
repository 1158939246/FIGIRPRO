Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (cost for Posters):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Posters'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (on 2019/9/4):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-09-04'\n\n* **Main Question (cost for Posters on the specified date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`cost` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_budget` = `T2`.`budget_id` WHERE `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Posters' AND `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-09-04'\n\n**3.
