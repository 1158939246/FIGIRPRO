Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the ID of the patient whose RF is normal and who is older than 60.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter patients based on two criteria: RF value and age. The `Patient` table contains the `ID` and `Birthday`, while the `Laboratory` table contains the `RF` value. We will join these tables on the `ID` column and apply the necessary filters.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <RF is normal> AND <patient is older than 60>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** RF is normal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `RF` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RF` < 20\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** patient is older than 60\n        * **Analysis:** To determine if a patient is older than 60, we can calculate the age by subtracting the year of the `Birthday` from the current year. We will use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the `Birthday`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) > 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (RF is normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RF` < 20\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (patient is older than 60):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) > 60\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`RF` < 20 AND STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) > 60\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
