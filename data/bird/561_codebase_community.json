This requires us to first identify the maximum score from the `comments` table and then find the corresponding post title from the `posts` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Title` FROM `posts` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`Id` = <PostId with highest score comment>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** PostId with highest score comment\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the post ID that corresponds to the maximum score in the `comments` table.

Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (PostId with highest score comment):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `PostId` FROM `comments` WHERE `Score` = (SELECT MAX(`Score`) FROM `comments`)\n\n* **Main Question (title of the post):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Title` FROM `posts` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`Id` = (SELECT `PostId` FROM `comments` WHERE `Score` = (SELECT MAX(`Score`) FROM `comments`))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `posts` and `comments` tables to avoid nested subqueries. We can group by the post ID and use the `MAX()` function to find the highest score directly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
