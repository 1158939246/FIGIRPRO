Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the percentage whereby Hamilton was not at the 1st track of the F1 circuit since 2010.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of races where Hamilton did not finish in the 1st position compared to the total races he participated in since 2010. This requires two counts: one for races where he finished in positions greater than 1 and another for all races he participated in.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `position` > 1, COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton') FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T3`.`year` >= 2010\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** COUNT of races where Hamilton finished in positions greater than 1\n        * **Analysis:** This count will filter results based on the surname 'Hamilton' and position greater than 1.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `position` > 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** COUNT of all races where Hamilton participated\n        * **Analysis:** This count will filter results based on the surname 'Hamilton'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (COUNT of races where Hamilton finished in positions greater than 1):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `T1`.`position` > 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (COUNT of all races where Hamilton participated):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `T1`.`position` > 1, COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`) WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton') FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T3`.`year` >= 2010\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a single `COUNT` with conditional aggregation to avoid multiple scans of the same data.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
