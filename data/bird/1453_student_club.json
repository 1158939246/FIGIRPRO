Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the name of events with less than average parking cost.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the names of events where the cost is less than the average parking cost. The average parking cost can be calculated from the `budget` table where the category is 'Parking'.

The average cost can be computed using `SUM(cost) / COUNT(event_id)` where the category is 'Parking'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`cost` < (SELECT SUM(`cost`) / COUNT(`event_id`) FROM `budget` WHERE `category` = 'Parking')\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by ensuring that we only select the necessary columns and perform the join correctly. We will also ensure that we handle any potential NULL values in the cost calculation.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
