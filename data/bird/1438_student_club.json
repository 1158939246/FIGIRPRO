This requires joining the `member` table with the `major` table based on the `link_to_major`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`college` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T1`.`first_name` = 'Katy' AND `T1`.`link_to_major` = 'rec1N0upiVLy5esTO'\n\n**2.
