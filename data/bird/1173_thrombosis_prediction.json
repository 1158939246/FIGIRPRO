Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the most common illness that doctors identified among the patients whose lab work was done between 1/1/1985, and 12/31/1995? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the occurrences of each diagnosis within the specified date range and then find the maximum count. This requires joining the `Examination` and `Patient` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Diagnosis`, COUNT(`Diagnosis`) AS `DiagnosisCount` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE <lab work date condition> GROUP BY `Diagnosis` ORDER BY `DiagnosisCount` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** lab work date condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Examination` table based on the `Examination Date` column to include only records between '1985-01-01' and '1995-12-31'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`Examination Date` BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1995-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (lab work date condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`Examination Date` BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1995-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (most common illness):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `P`.`Diagnosis`, COUNT(`P`.`Diagnosis`) AS `DiagnosisCount` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE `E`.`Examination Date` BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1995-12-31' GROUP BY `P`.`Diagnosis` ORDER BY `DiagnosisCount` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to find the most common diagnosis.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
