Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average number of badges obtained by a user with over 200 views?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average number of badges per user who has more than 200 views. This involves counting the badges and the distinct users who meet the view criteria.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`Id`) / COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`DisplayName`)) AS average_badges FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Views` > 200\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of badges\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we will count the `Id` from the `badges` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`Id`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of distinct users\n        * **Analysis:** We will count distinct `DisplayName` from the `users` table where the views are greater than 200.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`DisplayName`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Count of badges):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`Id`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Count of distinct users):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`DisplayName`)\n\n* **Main Question (average number of badges):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`Id`) / COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`DisplayName`)) AS average_badges FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Views` > 200\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `badges` and `users` tables based on the user ID, and we are filtering based on the views condition.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
