Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** From race no. 50 to 100, how many finishers have been disqualified?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of finishers who have been disqualified. A finisher is defined as having a `time` that is not null, and disqualified is indicated by `statusId = 2`. We will filter the results based on the `raceId` range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `results` WHERE <finisher> AND <disqualified> AND <raceId between 50 and 100>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** finisher\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `results` table where the `time` column is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** disqualified\n        * **Analysis:** This filter checks for the `statusId` in the `results` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `statusId` = 2\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** raceId between 50 and 100\n        * **Analysis:** This filter checks the `raceId` column in the `results` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` > 50 AND `raceId` < 100\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (finisher):**\n    * **SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (disqualified):**\n    * **SQL:** `statusId` = 2\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (raceId between 50 and 100):**\n    * **SQL:** `raceId` > 50 AND `raceId` < 100\n\n* **Main Question (count of disqualified finishers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `results` WHERE `time` IS NOT NULL AND `statusId` = 2 AND `raceId` > 50 AND `raceId` < 100\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of records that meet all the specified conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
