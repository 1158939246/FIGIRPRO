This involves counting the total number of superheroes in that height range and counting how many of those are published by Marvel Comics.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(<Marvel Heroes>) / COUNT(<Total Heroes>)) * 100 FROM <Superheroes> WHERE <Height Condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Marvel Heroes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the superheroes published by Marvel Comics. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `publisher` table to filter by `publisher_name = 'Marvel Comics'`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `publisher`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total Heroes\n        * **Analysis:** This is simply the count of all superheroes within the specified height range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(*)\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Height Condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter superheroes based on their height using the `height_cm` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `height_cm BETWEEN 150 AND 180`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Marvel Heroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `publisher`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Total Heroes):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(*)\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (Height Condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `height_cm BETWEEN 150 AND 180`\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN `publisher`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage FROM `superhero` AS `hero` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `publisher` ON `hero`.`publisher_id` = `publisher`.`id` WHERE `hero`.`height_cm` BETWEEN 150 AND 180\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `publisher` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
