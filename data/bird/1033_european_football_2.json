Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average height of players born between 1990 and 1995?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question requires calculating the average height of players, which can be derived from the `height` column in the `Player` table. We need to filter the players based on their birth dates.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`height`) FROM `Player` WHERE <players born between 1990 and 1995>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** players born between 1990 and 1995  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Player` table based on the `birthday` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `birthday` >= '1990-01-01 00:00:00' AND `birthday` < '1996-01-01 00:00:00'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (players born between 1990 and 1995):**  \n    * **SQL:** `birthday` >= '1990-01-01 00:00:00' AND `birthday` < '1996-01-01 00:00:00'\n\n* **Main Question (average height):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`height`) FROM `Player` WHERE `birthday` >= '1990-01-01 00:00:00' AND `birthday` < '1996-01-01 00:00:00'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly calculating the average height using the `AVG()` function on the filtered results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
