Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients who were examined between 1987/7/6 and 1996/1/31 had a GPT level greater than 30 and an ALB level less than 4? List them by their ID.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the patients based on the specified conditions. The relevant data is in the `Laboratory` table, which contains the `GPT`, `ALB`, and `Date` columns. We will filter the records based on the date range, GPT level, and ALB level.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `ID`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE <examined between dates> AND <GPT level condition> AND <ALB level condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** examined between 1987/7/6 and 1996/1/31\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `Date` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Date` BETWEEN '1987-07-06' AND '1996-01-31'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** GPT level greater than 30\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `GPT` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `GPT` > 30\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** ALB level less than 4\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `ALB` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ALB` < 4\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (examined between dates):**\n    * **SQL:** `Date` BETWEEN '1987-07-06' AND '1996-01-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (GPT level condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `GPT` > 30\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (ALB level condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `ALB` < 4\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `ID`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `Date` BETWEEN '1987-07-06' AND '1996-01-31' AND `GPT` > 30 AND `ALB` < 4\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with the necessary `WHERE` conditions to filter the data.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
