Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Give the team_fifa_api_id of teams with more than 50 but less than 60 build-up play speed.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the `team_fifa_api_id` from the `Team_Attributes` table where the `buildUpPlaySpeed` falls within the specified range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `team_fifa_api_id` FROM `Team_Attributes` WHERE <build-up play speed condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** build-up play speed condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `buildUpPlaySpeed` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `buildUpPlaySpeed` > 50 AND `buildUpPlaySpeed` < 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (build-up play speed condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `buildUpPlaySpeed` > 50 AND `buildUpPlaySpeed` < 60\n\n* **Main Question (team_fifa_api_id):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `team_fifa_api_id` FROM `Team_Attributes` WHERE `buildUpPlaySpeed` > 50 AND `buildUpPlaySpeed` < 60\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient and straightforward. It directly filters the `Team_Attributes` table based on the specified conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
