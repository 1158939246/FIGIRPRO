This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `alignment` table to filter for neutral superheroes and then calculating the average height from the `height_cm` column in the `superhero` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`height_cm`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `alignment` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`alignment_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <alignment is neutral>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** alignment is neutral\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results based on the alignment.
