Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the highest monthly consumption in the year 2012?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum consumption for the year 2012. This involves filtering the `yearmonth` table for entries where the year is 2012 and then applying the `MAX()` function to the `Consumption` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` WHERE <year is 2012>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** year is 2012\n        * **Analysis:** The year can be extracted from the `Date` column, which is in the format `YYYYMM`. We can filter for entries where the `Date` starts with '2012'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Date` LIKE '2012%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year is 2012):**\n    * **SQL:** `Date` LIKE '2012%'\n\n* **Main Question (highest monthly consumption):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` WHERE `Date` LIKE '2012%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `yearmonth` table for the year 2012 and calculating the maximum consumption.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
