This requires joining the `cards` table to find the UUID of the card and then using that UUID to find the corresponding ruling in the `rulings` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`text` FROM `rulings` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`name` = 'Beacon of Immortality'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the UUID of the card 'Beacon of Immortality'.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to filter the `cards` table by the card name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Beacon of Immortality'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (find the UUID of the card):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Beacon of Immortality'\n\n* **Main Question (retrieve the ruling):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`text` FROM `rulings` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`name` = 'Beacon of Immortality'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query is already efficient as it uses an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `cards` and `rulings` tables based on the UUID, and it filters directly by the card name.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
