We need to filter the data to only include schools located in Fresno, which is indicated by the `MailCity` column in the `schools` table. This requires a join between the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on the `cds` column in `satscores` and `CDSCode` in `schools`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`NumTstTakr`) FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <MailCity is Fresno>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** MailCity is Fresno\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `MailCity` column in the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`MailCity` = 'Fresno'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
