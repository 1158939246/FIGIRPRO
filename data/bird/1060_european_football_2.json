We need to filter the data to only include players born after 1990.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` WHERE <born after 1990>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born after 1990\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `birthday` column using the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `birthday`) > '1990'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born after 1990):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `birthday`) > '1990'\n\n* **Main Question (count of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `birthday`) > '1990'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of players based on the specified condition without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
