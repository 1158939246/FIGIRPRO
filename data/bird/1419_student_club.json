Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the category of event which was taken place in 2020-03-24T12:00:00?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the `category` of an event, which is stored in the `budget` table. We need to filter the results based on the `event_date` from the `event` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`category` FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_date` = '2020-03-24T12:00:00'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (category of event):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`category` FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_date` = '2020-03-24T12:00:00'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `budget` and `event` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
