This requires us to first identify the maximum speed and then find the corresponding driver and their nationality.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`nationality` FROM `drivers` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`driverId` = (SELECT `T1`.`driverId` FROM `results` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`fastestLapSpeed` = (SELECT MAX(`T2`.`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results` AS `T2`))\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum fastest lap speed\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation query to get the maximum value from the `fastestLapSpeed` column in the `results` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Find the driverId associated with the maximum fastest lap speed\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `results` table to find the `driverId` that corresponds to the maximum `fastestLapSpeed`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `results` WHERE `fastestLapSpeed` = <MAX fastestLapSpeed>\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum fastest lap speed):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (driverId associated with maximum fastest lap speed):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `results` WHERE `fastestLapSpeed` = (SELECT MAX(`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results`)\n\n* **Main Question (nationality of the driver):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`nationality` FROM `drivers` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`driverId` = (SELECT `T1`.`driverId` FROM `results` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`fastestLapSpeed` = (SELECT MAX(`T2`.`fastestLapSpeed`) FROM `results` AS `T2`))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by combining the sub-queries into a single query using a `JOIN` to directly link the `drivers` and `results` tables based on the maximum `fastestLapSpeed`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
