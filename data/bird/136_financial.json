Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (loan amount >= 250000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`amount` >= 250000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (loan date between 1/1/1995 and 12/31/1997):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`date` BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1997-12-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (frequency = 'POPLATEK MESICNE'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK MESICNE'\n\n* **Main Question (count of loans):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`loan_id`) FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`amount` >= 250000 AND `T1`.`date` BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1997-12-31' AND `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK MESICNE'\n\n**3.
