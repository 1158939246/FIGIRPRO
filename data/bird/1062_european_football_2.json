Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which players had an overall rating of over 80 from 2008 to 2010? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select player names from the `Player` table where the `overall_rating` is greater than 80 and the date falls between 2008 and 2010. The `overall_rating` is found in the `Player_Attributes` table, and we will need to join this table with the `Player` table to get the player names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <overall rating > 80> AND <date between 2008 and 2010>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** overall rating > 80\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `overall_rating` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`overall_rating` > 80\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date between 2008 and 2010\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `date` column in the `Player_Attributes` table using the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year and check if it falls between 2008 and 2010.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) BETWEEN '2008' AND '2010'`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (overall rating > 80):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`overall_rating` > 80\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date between 2008 and 2010):**\n    * **SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) BETWEEN '2008' AND '2010'`\n\n* **Main Question (player names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`overall_rating` > 80 AND STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) BETWEEN '2008' AND '2010'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
