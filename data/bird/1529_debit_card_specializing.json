How much had the customer spent in January 2012?  \n**Evidence**: January 2012 refers to the Date value = '201201'\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the amount spent by customer \"38508\" at the gas stations? How much had the customer spent in January 2012?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the total amount spent by customer \"38508\" and also filter the transactions for January 2012. The `transactions_1k` table contains the relevant information about the amounts spent.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n      ```sql\n      SELECT \n          SUM(Amount) AS total_spent,\n          SUM(CASE WHEN Date = '201201' THEN Amount ELSE 0 END) AS spent_january_2012 \n      FROM transactions_1k \n      WHERE CustomerID = 38508\n      ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Total amount spent by customer \"38508\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation of the `Amount` column for the specified `CustomerID`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SUM(Amount) WHERE CustomerID = 38508`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Amount spent in January 2012\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `Date` column for the value '201201' and summing the `Amount` for that specific month.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SUM(Amount) WHERE CustomerID = 38508 AND Date = '201201'`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total amount spent):**\n    * **SQL:** `SUM(Amount) WHERE CustomerID = 38508`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (amount spent in January 2012):**\n    * **SQL:** `SUM(Amount) WHERE CustomerID = 38508 AND Date = '201201'`\n\n* **Main Question (combined amounts):**\n    * **SQL:** \n      ```sql\n      SELECT \n          SUM(Amount) AS total_spent,\n          SUM(CASE WHEN Date = '201201' THEN Amount ELSE 0 END) AS spent_january_2012 \n      FROM transactions_1k \n      WHERE CustomerID = 38508\n      ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses a single aggregation query to calculate both the total amount spent and the amount spent in January 2012.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
