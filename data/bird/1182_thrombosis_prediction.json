Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patient who first came to the hospital on 1991/6/13 who was diagnosed with SJS, what is the total number of his/her Laboratory tests in 1995?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the count of laboratory tests for a specific patient based on their first visit date and diagnosis. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables and applying the necessary filters.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T3`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T3`.`ID` WHERE <patient first came on 1991/6/13> AND <patient diagnosed with SJS> AND <tests in 1995>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** patient first came on 1991/6/13  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `First Date` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`First Date` = '1991-06-13'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** patient diagnosed with SJS  \n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `Diagnosis` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SJS'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** tests in 1995  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Laboratory` tests based on the `Date` column. We will extract the year from the `Date` and check if it equals 1995.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T3`.`Date`) = '1995'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patient first came on 1991/6/13):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`First Date` = '1991-06-13'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (patient diagnosed with SJS):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SJS'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (tests in 1995):**  \n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T3`.`Date`) = '1995'\n\n* **Main Question (total number of Laboratory tests):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T3`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T3`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`First Date` = '1991-06-13' AND `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SJS' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T3`.`Date`) = '1995'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
