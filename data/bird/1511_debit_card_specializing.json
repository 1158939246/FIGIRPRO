This requires joining the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table on `CustomerID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`Price`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE <customers paid in euro>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** customers paid in euro\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table using the `Currency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n**2.
