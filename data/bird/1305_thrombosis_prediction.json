Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients accepted to the hospital have a normal level of white blood cells?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count patients who were admitted to the hospital and have a normal level of white blood cells. We will use the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables, joining them on the `ID` column. The filters will be based on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table and the `WBC` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <admitted to the hospital> AND <normal level of WBC>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** admitted to the hospital\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal level of WBC\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `WBC` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it falls within the normal range of 3.5 to 9.0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 9.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (admitted to the hospital):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal level of WBC):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 9.0\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Admission` = '+' AND `T2`.`WBC` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 9.0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
