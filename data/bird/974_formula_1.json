The `results` table contains the `fastestLapTime` and `raceId`, while the `races` table contains the `year` and `raceId`. We will need to join these tables and filter for the minimum `fastestLapTime`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `year` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE <fastest lap time> ORDER BY <fastest lap time> LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** fastest lap time\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to ensure we are only considering entries where `fastestLapTime` has values. This can be done by checking that `fastestLapTime` is not NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`fastestLapTime` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (fastest lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`fastestLapTime` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (year with fastest lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`year` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T2`.`fastestLapTime` IS NOT NULL ORDER BY `T2`.`fastestLapTime` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `races` and `results` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
