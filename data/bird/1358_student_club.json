This involves joining the `income` table (to get the payment information) with the `member` table (to get the member's name).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name` FROM `income` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <first paid dues> \n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** first paid dues\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `income` table for records where the `source` is 'Dues' and find the minimum `date_received`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`date_received` = (SELECT MIN(`date_received`) FROM `income` WHERE `source` = 'Dues')\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by ensuring that we directly join the tables and filter for the minimum date in a single query without unnecessary nesting.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
