The school codes are found in the `schools` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `CDSCode` FROM `schools` WHERE <total enrollment > 500>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** total enrollment > 500\n        * **Analysis:** This requires summing the two enrollment columns from the `frpm` table and filtering based on that sum.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (`Enrollment (K-12)` + `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) > 500\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total enrollment > 500):**\n    * **SQL:** (`T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` + `T1`.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) > 500\n\n* **Main Question (codes of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`CDSCode` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE (`T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` + `T1`.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) > 500\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `frpm` and `schools` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
