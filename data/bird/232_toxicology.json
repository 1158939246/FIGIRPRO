Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list top three molecules that have single bonds between two atoms and are not carcinogenic in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find molecules that are not carcinogenic and have single bonds. This requires joining the `molecule`, `bond`, and `connected` tables. We will filter based on the `label` of the molecule and the `bond_type`. Finally, we will select the top three `molecule_id` values in alphabetical order.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`molecule_id` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`bond_id` = `T3`.`bond_id` WHERE <not carcinogenic> AND <single bond> ORDER BY `T1`.`molecule_id` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** not carcinogenic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `molecule` table using the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`label` = '-'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** single bond\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (not carcinogenic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`label` = '-'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (single bond):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (top three molecules):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`molecule_id` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`bond_id` = `T3`.`bond_id` WHERE `T1`.`label` = '-' AND `T2`.`bond_type` = '-' ORDER BY `T1`.`molecule_id` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses are correctly applied to get the top three results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
