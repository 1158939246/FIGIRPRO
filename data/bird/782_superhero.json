Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the heroes' names whose eyes and hair colours are both black.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table where both `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` correspond to the color 'Black' in the `colour` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE <eyes are black> AND <hair is black>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** eyes are black\n        * **Analysis:** This requires a join with the `colour` table to filter based on the `eye_colour_id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Black')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** hair is black\n        * **Analysis:** Similar to sub-question 1, we need to join with the `colour` table to filter based on the `hair_colour_id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = (SELECT `T3`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`colour` = 'Black')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (eyes are black):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Black')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (hair is black):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = (SELECT `T3`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`colour` = 'Black')\n\n* **Main Question (heroes' names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Black') AND `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = (SELECT `T3`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`colour` = 'Black')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by combining the sub-queries for eye and hair color into a single join with the `colour` table. This avoids multiple sub-selects and improves readability.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
