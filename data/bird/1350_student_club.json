Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the status of the event which bought \"Post Cards, Posters\" on 2019/8/20?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `event_status` from the `budget` table, which is linked to the `expense` table where the `expense_description` is 'Post Cards, Posters' and the `expense_date` is '2019-08-20'. This requires joining the `expense`, `budget`, and `event` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`event_status` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_budget` = `T2`.`budget_id` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T3`.`event_id` WHERE `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Post Cards, Posters' AND `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** expense description is 'Post Cards, Posters'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Post Cards, Posters'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** expense date is '2019-08-20'\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `expense` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (expense description):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Post Cards, Posters'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (expense date):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n* **Main Question (event status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`event_status` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_budget` = `T2`.`budget_id` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T3`.`event_id` WHERE `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Post Cards, Posters' AND `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships and applying the filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
