Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many cards designed by UDON and available in mtgo print type has a starting maximum hand size of -1?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the cards that meet three criteria: designed by UDON, available in mtgo, and have a starting maximum hand size of -1. We will use the `cards` table for this.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <designed by UDON> AND <available in mtgo> AND <starting maximum hand size of -1>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** designed by UDON\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `artist` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `artist` = 'UDON'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** available in mtgo\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `availability` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `availability` = 'mtgo'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** starting maximum hand size of -1\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied directly to the `hand` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `hand` = -1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (designed by UDON):**\n    * **SQL:** `artist` = 'UDON'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (available in mtgo):**\n    * **SQL:** `availability` = 'mtgo'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (starting maximum hand size of -1):**\n    * **SQL:** `hand` = -1\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE `artist` = 'UDON' AND `availability` = 'mtgo' AND `hand` = -1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it directly filters the `cards` table based on the specified conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
