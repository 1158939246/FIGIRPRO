Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the websites address of the schools with a free meal count of 1,900-2,000 to students aged 5-17? Include the name of the school.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `Website` and `School` columns from the `schools` table, filtering for schools that have a free meal count between 1,900 and 2,000 for students aged 5-17. This information is found in the `frpm` table, which contains the `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Website`, `T1`.`School` FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `frpm` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <free meal count between 1900 and 2000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** free meal count between 1900 and 2000\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` column in the `frpm` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (free meal count between 1900 and 2000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000\n\n* **Main Question (websites and school names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Website`, `T1`.`School` FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `frpm` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T2`.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `schools` and `frpm` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
