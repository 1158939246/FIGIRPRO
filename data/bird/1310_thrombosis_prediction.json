This requires joining the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`PT`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <normal prothrombin time>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal prothrombin time\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Examination` table based on the `PT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`PT` < 14\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
