Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients who were female got white blood cells that were below 3.5?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of patients who meet two criteria: they are female and their white blood cell count (WBC) is below 3.5. The relevant columns are in the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables, which need to be joined based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <female patients> AND <WBC below 3.5>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** WBC below 3.5\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `WBC` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`WBC` < 3.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (WBC below 3.5):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`WBC` < 3.5\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`SEX` = 'F' AND `L`.`WBC` < 3.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
