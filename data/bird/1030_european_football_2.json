Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Give the name of the league that had the most matches end as a draw in the 2016 season?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of matches that ended in a draw (where `home_team_goal` equals `away_team_goal`) for the 2016 season and then find the league with the maximum count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name` FROM `League` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Match` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <matches ended in draw> AND <season is 2016> GROUP BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY <count of draws> DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** matches ended in draw\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `home_team_goal` is equal to the `away_team_goal`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`home_team_goal` = `T1`.`away_team_goal`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** season is 2016\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters the matches to only include those from the 2016 season.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (matches ended in draw):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`home_team_goal` = `T1`.`away_team_goal`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (season is 2016):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n* **Main Question (league with most draws):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name` FROM `League` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Match` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`home_team_goal` = `T1`.`away_team_goal` AND `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016' GROUP BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `League` and `Match` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to find the league with the most draws.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
