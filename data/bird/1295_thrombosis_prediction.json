This requires joining the `Laboratory` and `Examination` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <total bilirubin condition> AND <ANA pattern condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** total bilirubin condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `T-BIL` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ANA pattern condition\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Examination` table for records where the `ANA Pattern` contains 'P'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ANA Pattern` LIKE '%P%'\n\n**2.
