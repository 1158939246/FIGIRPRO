This requires joining the `member`, `major`, and potentially filtering based on the department.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE <students from Art and Design Department>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** students from Art and Design Department\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `major` table using the `department` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`department` = 'Art and Design Department'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (students from Art and Design Department):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`department` = 'Art and Design Department'\n\n* **Main Question (full names of students):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`department` = 'Art and Design Department'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
