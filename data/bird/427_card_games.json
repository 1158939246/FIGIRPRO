Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What languages are available in the set known as Archenemy on the magic card market and having the code ARC? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the languages from the `set_translations` table that correspond to the set with `mcmName = 'Archenemy'` and `setCode = 'ARC'`. This requires joining the `sets` table to filter by `mcmName` and `setCode`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T3`.`language` FROM `set_translations` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T2`.`mcmName` = 'Archenemy' AND `T2`.`code` = 'ARC'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter by set known as Archenemy\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `mcmName` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`mcmName` = 'Archenemy'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by having the code ARC\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `code` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`code` = 'ARC'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (set known as Archenemy):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`mcmName` = 'Archenemy'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (having the code ARC):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`code` = 'ARC'\n\n* **Main Question (languages available):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T3`.`language` FROM `set_translations` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T2`.`mcmName` = 'Archenemy' AND `T2`.`code` = 'ARC'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `set_translations` and `sets` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
