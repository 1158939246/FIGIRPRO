Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which user added a bounty amount of 50 to the post title mentioning variance? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `DisplayName` of the user who added a bounty of 50 to a post with a title that includes 'variance'. This requires joining the `votes` table (to get the bounty amount) with the `posts` table (to get the title) and then joining with the `users` table (to get the user's display name).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`DisplayName` FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T3`.`Id` WHERE <bounty amount of 50> AND <title mentioning variance>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bounty amount of 50\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `votes` table using the `BountyAmount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`BountyAmount` = 50\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** title mentioning variance\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `posts` table based on the `Title` column using the `LIKE` operator to check for the presence of 'variance'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Title` LIKE '%variance%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bounty amount of 50):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`BountyAmount` = 50\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (title mentioning variance):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Title` LIKE '%variance%'\n\n* **Main Question (user who added bounty):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`DisplayName` FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T3`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`BountyAmount` = 50 AND `T2`.`Title` LIKE '%variance%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
