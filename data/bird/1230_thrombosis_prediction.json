Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all outpatient within normal range of creatinine phosphokinase. Give me the distinct ids.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select distinct IDs from the `Patient` table where the `Admission` status indicates outpatient and the `CPK` value from the `Laboratory` table is less than 250. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <outpatient condition> AND <normal range of CPK condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** outpatient condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal range of CPK condition\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `CPK` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`CPK` < 250\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (outpatient condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal range of CPK condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`CPK` < 250\n\n* **Main Question (distinct IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Admission` = '-' AND `T2`.`CPK` < 250\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
