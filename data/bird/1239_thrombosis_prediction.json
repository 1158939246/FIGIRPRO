Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name the ID and age of patient with two or more laboratory examinations which show their hematoclit level exceeded the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` from the `Patient` table and calculate the age based on the `Birthday`. We will filter patients based on the count of their laboratory examinations where the `HCT` level exceeds the normal range (HCT >= 52).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ID`, SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday)) AS age FROM `Patient` WHERE <two or more laboratory examinations> AND <HCT exceeds normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** two or more laboratory examinations\n        * **Analysis:** This requires counting the number of laboratory examinations for each patient. We will join the `Patient` table with the `Laboratory` table on `ID` and filter for those with a count greater than 2.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`L`.`ID`) > 2\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** HCT exceeds normal range\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the laboratory examinations where `HCT >= 52`. This will be part of the join condition.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`HCT` >= 52\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (two or more laboratory examinations):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`L`.`ID`) > 2\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (HCT exceeds normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`HCT` >= 52\n\n* **Main Question (ID and age of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT `P`.`ID`, SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(`P`.`Birthday`)) AS age \n    FROM `Patient` AS `P` \n    INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` \n    WHERE `L`.`HCT` >= 52 \n    GROUP BY `P`.`ID` \n    HAVING COUNT(`L`.`ID`) > 2\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause effectively filters for patients with two or more examinations that meet the criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
