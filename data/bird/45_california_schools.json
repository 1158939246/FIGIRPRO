This requires joining the `satscores` table (which contains writing scores) with the `schools` table (which contains school management information). We will filter the results based on the administrator's name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`sname`, AVG(`T1`.`AvgScrWrite`) FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <administrator is Ricci Ulrich> GROUP BY `T2`.`sname`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** administrator is Ricci Ulrich\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `schools` table to find records where the administrator's first name is Ricci and last name is Ulrich.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`AdmFName1` = 'Ricci' AND `T2`.`AdmLName1` = 'Ulrich'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause is necessary to calculate the average score for each school.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
