The relevant column for the trading date is `date` in the `account` table. We will filter for dates in 1995 and then find the minimum date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `account_id` FROM `account` WHERE `date` = <earliest trading date in 1995>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** earliest trading date in 1995\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `account` table for dates in 1995 and then find the minimum date using the `MIN()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MIN(`date`) FROM `account` WHERE `date` LIKE '1995%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (earliest trading date in 1995):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MIN(`date`) FROM `account` WHERE `date` LIKE '1995%'\n\n* **Main Question (accounts with earliest trading date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `account_id` FROM `account` WHERE `date` = (SELECT MIN(`date`) FROM `account` WHERE `date` LIKE '1995%')\n\n**3.
