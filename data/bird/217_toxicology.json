This requires us to first identify the atoms associated with the TR181 molecule and then find the connected atoms using the `connected` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`atom_id` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` WHERE `T1`.`molecule_id` = 'TR181'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify atoms of the TR181 molecule.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward selection from the `atom` table where the `molecule_id` is 'TR181'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`molecule_id` = 'TR181'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Find connected atoms.\n        * **Analysis:** We will join the `connected` table to get the connected atoms based on the `atom_id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`atom_id` = `T1`.`atom_id`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (atoms of the TR181 molecule):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`molecule_id` = 'TR181'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (connected atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`atom_id` = `T1`.`atom_id`\n\n* **Main Question (connected atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`atom_id` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` WHERE `T1`.`molecule_id` = 'TR181'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `atom` and `connected` tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
