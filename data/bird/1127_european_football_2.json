The `Player_Attributes` table contains the vision scores, and the `Player` table contains player information. To get the country, we need to join with the `Team` and `League` tables, as the country is associated with the teams.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name`, `T3`.`name` FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`player_api_id` = `T3`.`team_api_id` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`team_api_id` = `T4`.`country_id` WHERE `T1`.`vision` > 89\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** vision scores of 90 and above\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player_Attributes` table using the `vision` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`vision` > 89\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Retrieve the country of these players\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `Player`, `Team`, and `League` tables to get the country name associated with each player.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** Join `Player` with `Team` and then `Team` with `League` to get the country name.\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (vision scores of 90 and above):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`vision` > 89\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (retrieve the country):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM `League` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T3` ON `T4`.`country_id` = `T3`.`team_api_id` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id`\n\n* **Main Question (players with vision scores and their countries):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`player_name`, `T4`.`name` FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`player_api_id` = `T3`.`team_api_id` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`team_api_id` = `T4`.`country_id` WHERE `T1`.`vision` > 89\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
