This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `colour` table to filter based on skin colour.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`eye_colour_id` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`skin_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <skin colour is gold>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** skin colour is gold\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `colour` table where we check if the `colour` column equals 'Gold'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Gold'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (skin colour is gold):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Gold'\n\n* **Main Question (eye colours of heroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`eye_colour_id` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`skin_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Gold'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `colour` tables based on the skin colour, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
