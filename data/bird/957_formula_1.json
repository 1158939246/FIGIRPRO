This requires filtering based on the nationality of the drivers and checking for null values in the results.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `drivers` AS `D` INNER JOIN `results` AS `R` ON `D`.`driverId` = `R`.`driverId` WHERE <driver is Italian> AND <time is null>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** driver is Italian  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `drivers` table using the `nationality` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `D`.`nationality` = 'Italian'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** time is null  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `results` table to check for null values in the `time` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `R`.`time` IS NULL\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
