Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among all the players whose weight is under 130, how many of them preferred foot in attacking is left?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count players based on two conditions: their weight must be under 130, and their preferred foot must be 'left'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Player WHERE <weight condition> AND <preferred foot condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** weight condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `weight` column in the `Player` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** weight < 130\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** preferred foot condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `preferred_foot` column in the `Player_Attributes` table. We will need to join the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on `player_api_id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** preferred_foot = 'left'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (weight condition):**\n    * **SQL:** weight < 130\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (preferred foot condition):**\n    * **SQL:** preferred_foot = 'left'\n\n* **Main Question (count of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Player AS P INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS PA ON P.player_api_id = PA.player_api_id WHERE P.weight < 130 AND PA.preferred_foot = 'left'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
