This requires a join between the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`DIAGNOSIS` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <severe degree of thrombosis>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** severe degree of thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `THROMBOSIS` column in the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`THROMBOSIS` = 2\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (severe degree of thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`THROMBOSIS` = 2\n\n* **Main Question (ID, sex, and disease):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`DIAGNOSIS` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`THROMBOSIS` = 2\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
