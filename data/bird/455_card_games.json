Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which of the cards that are a promotional painting have multiple faces on the same card? Please list their names.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter cards based on two conditions: they must be promotional paintings (`isPromo = 1`) and they must have multiple faces (`side IS NOT NULL`). The name of the card is in the `cards` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE <is a promotional painting> AND <has multiple faces>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** is a promotional painting\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `isPromo` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `isPromo = 1`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** has multiple faces\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `side` column is not NULL, indicating that the card has multiple faces.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `side IS NOT NULL`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (is a promotional painting):**\n    * **SQL:** `isPromo = 1`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (has multiple faces):**\n    * **SQL:** `side IS NOT NULL`\n\n* **Main Question (list of card names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `isPromo = 1` AND `side IS NOT NULL`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `cards` table based on the specified conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
