We will use the `COUNT()` function for this purpose.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE <views above average>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** views above average\n        * **Analysis:** To determine which posts have views above average, we need to calculate the average `ViewCount` and compare each post's `ViewCount` against this average.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ViewCount` > (SELECT AVG(ViewCount) FROM posts)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (views above average):**\n    * **SQL:** `ViewCount` > (SELECT AVG(ViewCount) FROM posts)\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE ViewCount > (SELECT AVG(ViewCount) FROM posts)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to calculate the average `ViewCount`, and the main query counts the posts that exceed this average.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
