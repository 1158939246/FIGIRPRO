Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please provide the full name of the away team that scored the most goals.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `team_long_name` from the `Team` table for the away team that has the maximum `away_team_goal` from the `Match` table. This requires joining the `Match` and `Team` tables based on the `away_team_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`team_long_name` FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`away_team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE <away team scored the most goals>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** away team scored the most goals\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the matches to find the maximum goals scored by the away team.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`away_team_goal` = (SELECT MAX(`away_team_goal`) FROM `Match`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (away team scored the most goals):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`away_team_goal` = (SELECT MAX(`away_team_goal`) FROM `Match`)\n\n* **Main Question (full name of the away team):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`team_long_name` FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`away_team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`away_team_goal` = (SELECT MAX(`away_team_goal`) FROM `Match`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Match` and `Team` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
