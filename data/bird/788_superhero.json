Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female heroes):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`gender_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `gender` WHERE `gender` = 'Female')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total heroes published by Marvel Comics):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`publisher_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `publisher` WHERE `publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics')\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN `T1`.`gender_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `gender` WHERE `gender` = 'Female') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percent FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`publisher_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `publisher` WHERE `publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `CASE` statement to count female heroes and a `COUNT(*)` to get the total number of heroes published by Marvel Comics.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
