Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify Lewis Hamilton):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`forename` = 'Lewis' AND `T1`.`surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Find the first race):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`year` = (SELECT MIN(`year`) FROM `races` WHERE `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `driverStandings` WHERE `driverId` = `T1`.`driverId`))\n\n* **Main Question (first race and points):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`raceId`, `T2`.`points` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `driverStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`forename` = 'Lewis' AND `T1`.`surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `T3`.`year = (SELECT MIN(year) FROM races WHERE raceId IN (SELECT raceId FROM driverStandings WHERE driverId = T1.driverId))`\n\n**3.
