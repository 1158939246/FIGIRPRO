The relevant tables are `lapTimes` for lap time and `drivers` for the introduction website. We will filter the lap time and race ID accordingly.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`url` FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <lap time is 0:01:27> AND <race number is 161>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** lap time is 0:01:27  \n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `lapTimes` table for the specific lap time format.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`time` LIKE '1:27%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race number is 161  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `raceId` column in the `lapTimes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 161\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (lap time is 0:01:27):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`time` LIKE '1:27%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race number is 161):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 161\n\n* **Main Question (driver's introduction website):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`url` FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`time` LIKE '1:27%' AND `T1`.`raceId` = 161\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `lapTimes` and `drivers` tables based on the driver ID, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
