This requires filtering based on the `Laboratory` and `Examination` tables, and we will need to join them on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `P`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <normal triglyceride level> AND <other symptoms observed>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal triglyceride level\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `TG` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`TG` < 200\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** other symptoms observed\n        * **Analysis:** This filter checks for non-null values in the `Symptoms` column from the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal triglyceride level):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`TG` < 200\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (other symptoms observed):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `P`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`TG` < 200 AND `E`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
