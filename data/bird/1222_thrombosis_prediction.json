We will need to filter the `Patient` table for males and join it with the `Examination` table to check the creatinine levels.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <creatinine index out of normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** creatinine index out of normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Examination` table based on the `CRE` column, which represents the creatinine level.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`CRE` >= 1.5\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
