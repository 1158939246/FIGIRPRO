Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the male superheroes, list the super hero names of superheroes with weight greater than the 79% average weight of all superheroes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter superheroes based on gender and their weight compared to the average weight of all superheroes. The `superhero` table contains the `superhero_name` and `weight_kg`, while the `gender` table provides the gender information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <weight greater than 79% average weight> AND <gender is Male>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** weight greater than 79% average weight\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average weight of all superheroes and then filter those whose weight is greater than 79% of that average.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` > (SELECT AVG(`weight_kg`) * 0.79 FROM `superhero`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** gender is Male\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `gender` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`gender` = 'Male'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (weight greater than 79% average weight):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` > (SELECT AVG(`weight_kg`) * 0.79 FROM `superhero`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (gender is Male):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`gender` = 'Male'\n\n* **Main Question (superhero names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` > (SELECT AVG(`weight_kg`) * 0.79 FROM `superhero`) AND `T2`.`gender` = 'Male'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `gender` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
