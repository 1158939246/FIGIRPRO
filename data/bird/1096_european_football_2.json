This requires joining the `Player` table to get the player_id corresponding to 'Pietro Marino' and then using that to filter the `Player_Attributes` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(T1.overall_rating) FROM Player_Attributes AS T1 INNER JOIN Player AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE <player_name = 'Pietro Marino'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** player_name = 'Pietro Marino'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** T2.player_name = 'Pietro Marino'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (player_name = 'Pietro Marino'):**\n    * **SQL:** T2.player_name = 'Pietro Marino'\n\n* **Main Question (average overall rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(T1.overall_rating) FROM Player_Attributes AS T1 INNER JOIN Player AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.player_name = 'Pietro Marino'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
