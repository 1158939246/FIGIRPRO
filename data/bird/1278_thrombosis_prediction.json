Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Of the patients with a normal level of IGG, how many of them admitted to the hospital?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who have an IGG level within the specified range and have been admitted to the hospital. This requires filtering based on the `IGG` column in the `Laboratory` table and the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table. We will need to join these two tables on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <normal level of IGG> AND <admitted to the hospital>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal level of IGG  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `IGG` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`IGG` > 900 AND `L`.`IGG` < 2000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** admitted to the hospital  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal level of IGG):**  \n    * **SQL:** `L`.`IGG` > 900 AND `L`.`IGG` < 2000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (admitted to the hospital):**  \n    * **SQL:** `P`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`IGG` > 900 AND `L`.`IGG` < 2000 AND `P`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
