We will join the `member` and `major` tables on the `link_to_major` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`phone` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE <major is Business> AND <college is College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** major is Business\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `major` table using the `major_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`major_name` = 'Business'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** college is College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `major` table using the `college` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`college` = 'College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (major is Business):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`major_name` = 'Business'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (college is College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`college` = 'College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences'\n\n* **Main Question (phone numbers of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`phone` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`major_name` = 'Business' AND `T2`.`college` = 'College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
