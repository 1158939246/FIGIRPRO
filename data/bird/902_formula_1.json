                "plan": "**Question**: Which race was Alex Yoong in when he was in track number less than 20?  \n**Evidence**: Alex Yoong refers to the full name of the driver; Full name of the driver refers to drivers.forename and drivers.surname; track number less than 20 refers to position < 20.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which race was Alex Yoong in when he was in track number less than 20?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the race details where the driver Alex Yoong participated and had a position less than 20. This requires joining the `drivers`, `results`, and `races` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`raceId` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE <driver is Alex Yoong> AND <position < 20>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** driver is Alex Yoong  \n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering based on the `forename` and `surname` columns in the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`forename` = 'Alex' AND `T2`.`surname` = 'Yoong'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** position < 20  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `results` table using the `position` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`position` < 20\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (driver is Alex Yoong):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`forename` = 'Alex' AND `T2`.`surname` = 'Yoong'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (position < 20):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`position` < 20\n\n* **Main Question (race details):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`raceId` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T2`.`forename` = 'Alex' AND `T2`.`surname` = 'Yoong' AND `T1`.`position` < 20\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applied the filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
