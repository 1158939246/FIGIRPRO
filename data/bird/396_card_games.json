Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many cards with a 1993 frame version and available on paper have a sensitive content warning?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the cards that meet three criteria: they have a frame version of 1993, they are available on paper, and they have a sensitive content warning. All these conditions can be applied directly to the `cards` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <frame version is 1993> AND <available on paper> AND <sensitive content warning>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** frame version is 1993\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `frameVersion` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `frameVersion` = '1993'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** available on paper\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `availability` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `availability` = 'paper'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** sensitive content warning\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `hasContentWarning` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `hasContentWarning` = 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (frame version is 1993):**\n    * **SQL:** `frameVersion` = '1993'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (available on paper):**\n    * **SQL:** `availability` = 'paper'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (sensitive content warning):**\n    * **SQL:** `hasContentWarning` = 1\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE `frameVersion` = '1993' AND `availability` = 'paper' AND `hasContentWarning` = 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of cards that meet all specified conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
