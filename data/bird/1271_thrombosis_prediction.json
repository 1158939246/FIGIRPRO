The 'Patient' table is also required because it includes the 'First Date' column, which tells us when a patient first came to the hospital. We need to filter patients based on this date to ensure they came before the year 2000. Finally, we need to count distinct patients, which can be achieved by joining these two tables on the 'ID' column, as it serves as the foreign key in the 'Laboratory' table referencing the 'Patient' table.

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients with a normal anti-SSA came to the hospital before 2000?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who have a normal anti-SSA and whose `First Date` is before the year 2000. The relevant columns are in the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables, which we will join on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal anti-SSA> AND <came to the hospital before 2000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal anti-SSA  \n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters the `SSA` column in the `Laboratory` table for values that indicate a normal anti-SSA.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SSA` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** came to the hospital before 2000  \n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters the `First Date` column in the `Patient` table to ensure the date is before the year 2000.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`T2`.`First Date`) < 2000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal anti-SSA):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SSA` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (came to the hospital before 2000):**  \n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`First Date`) < '2000'\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`SSA` IN ('-', '+-') AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`First Date`) < '2000'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
