Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which superhero has the same eyes, hair and skin colour? Indicate the publisher of the superhero.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `superhero_name` and the `publisher_name` for superheroes that have matching `hair_colour_id`, `skin_colour_id`, and `eye_colour_id`. This requires joining the `superhero` and `publisher` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`publisher_name`, `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <same eyes, hair and skin colour>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** same eyes, hair and skin colour\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be expressed as a simple equality check between the relevant columns in the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T1`.`skin_colour_id` AND `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T1`.`eye_colour_id`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (same eyes, hair and skin colour):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T1`.`skin_colour_id` AND `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T1`.`eye_colour_id`\n\n* **Main Question (superhero and publisher):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`publisher_name`, `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T1`.`skin_colour_id` AND `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T1`.`eye_colour_id`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `publisher` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
