Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the most laps f1 races had? Name the race, year and circuit location where the races with most laps was hosted.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum number of laps from the `races` table and then retrieve the corresponding race name, year, and circuit location. This requires a `JOIN` between the `races` and `circuits` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`year`, `T2`.`location` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE <most laps>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** most laps\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum laps from the `races` table. This can be done using the `MAX()` function after grouping by the `raceId`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`laps` = (SELECT MAX(`laps`) FROM `races`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (most laps):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`laps` = (SELECT MAX(`laps`) FROM `races`)\n\n* **Main Question (race name, year, and circuit location):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`year`, `T2`.`location` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE `T1`.`laps` = (SELECT MAX(`laps`) FROM `races`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `races` and `circuits` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
