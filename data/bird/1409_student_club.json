Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Mention the total expense used on 8/20/2019.\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the total expense, which can be calculated using the `SUM()` function on the `cost` column in the `expense` table. We need to filter the records based on the `expense_date`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`cost`) FROM `expense` WHERE <expense_date = '2019-08-20'>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** expense_date = '2019-08-20'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `expense_date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (expense_date = '2019-08-20'):**\n    * **SQL:** `expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n* **Main Question (total expense):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`cost`) FROM `expense` WHERE `expense_date` = '2019-08-20'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly calculates the total expense for the specified date without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
