Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the IDs of the patients who had the examination done after 1997/1/1 and had a normal anti-scl70.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` of patients from the `Examination` table based on two conditions: the examination date must be after January 1, 1997, and the `SC170` value must indicate a normal result.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ID` FROM `Examination` WHERE <examination done after 1997/1/1> AND <normal anti-scl70>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** examination done after 1997/1/1\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table using the `Examination Date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Examination Date` > '1997-01-01'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal anti-scl70\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `SC170` column for values that indicate a normal result.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SC170` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (examination done after 1997/1/1):**\n    * **SQL:** `Examination Date` > '1997-01-01'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal anti-scl70):**\n    * **SQL:** `SC170` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `ID` FROM `Examination` WHERE `Examination Date` > '1997-01-01' AND `SC170` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `Examination` table based on the specified conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
