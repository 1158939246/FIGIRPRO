The lap record is represented by the `time` column in the `lapTimes` table. The coordinates are stored in the `circuits` table, specifically in the `lat` and `lng` columns. We will need to join the `lapTimes` and `races` tables to access the `circuitId`, and then join with the `circuits` table to get the coordinates.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`lat`, `T3`.`lng` FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`circuitId` = `T3`.`circuitId` WHERE <lap record is 1:29.488>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** lap record is 1:29.488\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `lapTimes` table using the `time` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`time` = '1:29.488'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (lap record is 1:29.488):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`time` = '1:29.488'\n\n* **Main Question (location coordinates):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`lat`, `T3`.`lng` FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`circuitId` = `T3`.`circuitId` WHERE `T1`.`time` = '1:29.488'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
