Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the set of cards with \"Ancestor's Chosen\" in it, is there a Korean version of it? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to check if there exists a Korean version of the card \"Ancestor's Chosen\". This involves checking the `foreign_data` table for entries that match the card name and language.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM `foreign_data` WHERE <is Korean version> AND <is Ancestor's Chosen>)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** is Korean version\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `foreign_data` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `language` = 'Korean'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** is Ancestor's Chosen\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the card's UUID from the `cards` table where the name matches \"Ancestor's Chosen\". This requires a join between the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `uuid` IN (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (is Korean version):**\n    * **SQL:** `language` = 'Korean'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (is Ancestor's Chosen):**\n    * **SQL:** `uuid` IN (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen')\n\n* **Main Question (check existence):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM `foreign_data` WHERE `language` = 'Korean' AND `uuid` IN (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to filter the `foreign_data` based on the existence of the card in the `cards` table.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
