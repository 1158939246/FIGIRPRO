Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients with a normal level of complement 3 have a P pattern observed in the sheet of ANA examination?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who meet two criteria: a normal level of complement 3 (C3 > 35) and a P pattern in the ANA examination. This requires joining the `Laboratory` and `Examination` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal level of complement 3> AND <P pattern in ANA examination>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal level of complement 3  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `C3` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`C3` > 35\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** P pattern in ANA examination  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `ANA Pattern` column in the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ANA Pattern` = 'P'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal level of complement 3):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`C3` > 35\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (P pattern in ANA examination):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ANA Pattern` = 'P'\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`C3` > 35 AND `T2`.`ANA Pattern` = 'P'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
