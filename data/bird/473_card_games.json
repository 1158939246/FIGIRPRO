This requires joining the `cards`, `foreign_data`, and `sets` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT <check if isForeignOnly = 1> FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`uuid` = `T3`.`uuid` WHERE `T3`.`name` = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Check if `isForeignOnly = 1`\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`isForeignOnly` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Identify the card with name 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`name` = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (isForeignOnly = 1):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`isForeignOnly` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (card name):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`name` = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'\n\n* **Main Question (check availability):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`uuid` = `T3`.`uuid` WHERE `T3`.`name` = 'Adarkar Valkyrie' AND `T1`.`isForeignOnly` = 1\n\n**3.

We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships and applying the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
