Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the bond type and the bond ID of the atom 45.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `bond_type` and `bond_id` for the atom with an ID that corresponds to the condition `SUBSTR(atom_id, 7, 2) + 0 = 45`. This requires filtering the `connected` table based on the `atom_id` and then joining with the `bond` table to get the `bond_type`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`bond_type`, `T1`.`bond_id` FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` WHERE SUBSTR(`T1`.`atom_id`, 7, 2) + 0 = 45\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bond ID of atom 45\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `connected` table using the `SUBSTR` function to extract the relevant part of the `atom_id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUBSTR(`T1`.`atom_id`, 7, 2) + 0 = 45\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** bond type\n        * **Analysis:** The bond type is retrieved from the `bond` table, which we will join with the `connected` table based on the `bond_id`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` IS NOT NULL (to ensure we only get valid bond types)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bond ID of atom 45):**\n    * **SQL:** SUBSTR(`T1`.`atom_id`, 7, 2) + 0 = 45\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (bond type):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (bond type and bond ID):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`bond_type`, `T1`.`bond_id` FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` WHERE SUBSTR(`T1`.`atom_id`, 7, 2) + 0 = 45 AND `T2`.`bond_type` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
