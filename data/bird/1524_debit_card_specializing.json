Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What's the nationality of the customer who spent 548.4 in 2012/8/24? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the nationality of a customer based on their spending on a specific date. The spending amount is found in the `transactions_1k` table, and we need to join this with the `customers` table to get the nationality. \n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Country` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE <spending amount> AND <transaction date>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** spending amount\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the transactions to find those with an `Amount` of 548.4.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Amount` = 548.4\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** transaction date\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the transactions to find those that occurred on '2012-08-24'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-24'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (spending amount):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Amount` = 548.4\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (transaction date):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-24'\n\n* **Main Question (nationality of the customer):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Country` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T1`.`Amount` = 548.4 AND `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-24'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
