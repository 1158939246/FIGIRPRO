Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the sets whose expansion type is Commander, which set has the highest total number of cards including promotional and related supplemental products but excluding Alchemy modifications? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `id` of the set with the maximum `totalSetSize` where the `type` is 'commander'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `id` FROM `sets` WHERE <type is commander> ORDER BY <totalSetSize> DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** type is commander\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `type` = 'commander'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest total number of cards\n        * **Analysis:** We will use the `MAX()` function on the `totalSetSize` column after filtering for the `type`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `totalSetSize` = MAX(`totalSetSize`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (type is commander):**\n    * **SQL:** `type` = 'commander'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest total number of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`totalSetSize`) FROM `sets` WHERE `type` = 'commander'\n\n* **Main Question (id of the set with highest totalSetSize):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `id` FROM `sets` WHERE `type` = 'commander' AND `totalSetSize` = (SELECT MAX(`totalSetSize`) FROM `sets` WHERE `type` = 'commander')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly using a `ORDER BY` clause with `LIMIT 1` to get the set with the highest `totalSetSize` without needing to use `MAX()` in a subquery.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
