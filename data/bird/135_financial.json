Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** After making a credit card withdrawal, how many accounts with monthly issuance have a negative balance?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the accounts that have a negative balance after a transaction of type 'VYBER KARTOU' and have a frequency of 'POPLATEK MESICNE'.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `trans` and `account` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
