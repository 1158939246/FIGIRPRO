Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Identify the atoms belong to the molecule with ID between TR010 to TR050 that contain the element carbon.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select atoms that meet two criteria: they belong to molecules with IDs in the specified range and they contain the element carbon. The relevant tables are `atom` and `molecule`, which we will join based on `molecule_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`atom_id` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <molecule ID between TR010 and TR050> AND <element is carbon>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** molecule ID between TR010 and TR050\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied to the `molecule` table using the `molecule_id` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`molecule_id` LIKE 'TR0%' AND CAST(SUBSTR(`T2`.`molecule_id`, 3, 3) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 10 AND 50\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** element is carbon\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `atom` table using the `element` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (molecule ID between TR010 and TR050):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`molecule_id` LIKE 'TR0%' AND CAST(SUBSTR(`T2`.`molecule_id`, 3, 3) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 10 AND 50\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (element is carbon):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n* **Main Question (selecting atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`atom_id` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T2`.`molecule_id` LIKE 'TR0%' AND CAST(SUBSTR(`T2`.`molecule_id`, 3, 3) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 10 AND 50 AND `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `atom` and `molecule` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
