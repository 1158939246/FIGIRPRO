Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** There's one customer spent 214582.17 in the June of 2013, which currency did he/she use?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the currency used by a customer who spent a specific amount in a specific month and year. The relevant tables are `yearmonth` for the spending details and `customers` for the currency information. We will join these tables based on `CustomerID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Currency` FROM `customers` AS `C` INNER JOIN `yearmonth` AS `Y` ON `C`.`CustomerID` = `Y`.`CustomerID` WHERE <spending amount> AND <date in June 2013>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** spending amount\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `yearmonth` table for the specific spending amount.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Y`.`Consumption` = 214582.17\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date in June 2013\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `yearmonth` table for entries where the `Date` contains '201306'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Y`.`Date` LIKE '201306%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (spending amount):**\n    * **SQL:** `Y`.`Consumption` = 214582.17\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date in June 2013):**\n    * **SQL:** `Y`.`Date` LIKE '201306%'\n\n* **Main Question (currency used):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Currency` FROM `customers` AS `C` INNER JOIN `yearmonth` AS `Y` ON `C`.`CustomerID` = `Y`.`CustomerID` WHERE `Y`.`Consumption` = 214582.17 AND `Y`.`Date` LIKE '201306%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
