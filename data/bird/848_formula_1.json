This requires joining the `races` table with the `circuits` table based on the `circuitId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`year` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE <circuit location is Shanghai>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** circuit location is Shanghai\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `circuits` table to find those with the `name` equal to 'Shanghai'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Shanghai'\n\n**2.
