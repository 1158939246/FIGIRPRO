Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many active and closed District Community Day Schools are there in the county of Alpine? \n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of District Community Day Schools in the county of Alpine. We need to filter based on the `County` and `School Type` columns in the `schools` table, and we will also consider the `StatusType` to include both active and closed schools.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE <county is Alpine> AND <school type is District Community Day Schools>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** county is Alpine\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `County` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `County` = 'Alpine'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** school type is District Community Day Schools\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `School Type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `School Type` = 'District Community Day Schools'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (county is Alpine):**\n    * **SQL:** `County` = 'Alpine'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (school type is District Community Day Schools):**\n    * **SQL:** `School Type` = 'District Community Day Schools'\n\n* **Main Question (count of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE `County` = 'Alpine' AND `School Type` = 'District Community Day Schools'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly counting the number of schools that meet both conditions without any unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
