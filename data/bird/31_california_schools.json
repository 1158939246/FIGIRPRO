Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the eligible free rate of the 10th and 11th schools with the highest enrollment for students in grades 1 through 12?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the eligible free rate for schools based on the formula provided and filter for the top 11 schools by enrollment. The eligible free rate is calculated as `Free Meal Count (K-12)` divided by `Enrollment (K-12)`. We will need to order the results by enrollment and limit the results to the 10th and 11th entries.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `School Name`, (`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) AS `Eligible Free Rate` FROM `frpm` WHERE <K-12 enrollment> ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` DESC LIMIT 11 OFFSET 9\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** K-12 enrollment\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `frpm` table to ensure we are only considering schools that have valid enrollment data.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Enrollment (K-12)` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are filtering for non-null enrollment values and ordering by enrollment to get the top schools. The use of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` allows us to directly access the 10th and 11th entries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
