We will need to join the `superhero` table with the `colour` table to filter by the hair color.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <hair color is blonde>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** hair color is blonde  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `colour` table where we check for the color 'Blond'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Blond'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (hair color is blonde):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Blond'\n\n* **Main Question (count of superheroes with blonde hair):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Blond'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
