Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the comment's rating score of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:19:56 PM? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the score of comments associated with a specific post. This requires joining the `posts` and `comments` tables based on the post ID. The filtering will be done based on the `CreationDate` of the post.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Score` FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE <post created on 7/19/2010 7:19:56 PM>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** post created on 7/19/2010 7:19:56 PM\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `CreationDate` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:19:56.0'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (post created on 7/19/2010 7:19:56 PM):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:19:56.0'\n\n* **Main Question (comment's rating score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Score` FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE `P`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:19:56.0'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `comments` and `posts` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
