This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table to get the `power_id`, and then joining with the `superpower` table to get the `power_name`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Hunter Zolomon'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (list of powers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Hunter Zolomon'\n\n**3.
