Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patient with the highest lactate dehydrogenase in the normal range, when was his or her data first recorded?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of `LDH` that is less than 500 and then find the corresponding patient's `First Date` of data recording. This requires joining the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables based on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MIN(`First Date`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`LDH` = (SELECT MAX(`LDH`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `LDH` < 500)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest lactate dehydrogenase in the normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation to find the maximum `LDH` value that is less than 500.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`LDH`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `LDH` < 500\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest lactate dehydrogenase in the normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`LDH`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `LDH` < 500\n\n* **Main Question (first recorded date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MIN(`First Date`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`LDH` = (SELECT MAX(`LDH`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `LDH` < 500)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
