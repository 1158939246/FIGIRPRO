                "plan": "**Question**: List all the card id and artist with unknown power which are legal for commander play format.  \n**Evidence**: unknown power refers to power = '*' or POWER IS NULL; commander play format refers to format = 'commander'; legal for commander play format refers to format = 'commander' where status = 'Legal'\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all the card id and artist with unknown power which are legal for commander play format.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `id` and `artist` from the `cards` table where the power is unknown and the card is legal for the commander format. This involves filtering based on the `power` column and joining with the `legalities` table to check the format and status.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id`, `T1`.`artist` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <unknown power> AND <legal for commander play format>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** unknown power\n        * **Analysis:** This can be checked using the `power` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`power` = '*' OR `T1`.`power` IS NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** legal for commander play format\n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking the `format` and `status` columns in the `legalities` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`format` = 'commander' AND `T2`.`status` = 'Legal'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (unknown power):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`power` = '*' OR `T1`.`power` IS NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (legal for commander play format):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`format` = 'commander' AND `T2`.`status` = 'Legal'\n\n* **Main Question (card id and artist):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id`, `T1`.`artist` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`power` = '*' OR `T1`.`power` IS NULL AND `T2`.`format` = 'commander' AND `T2`.`status` = 'Legal'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `cards` and `legalities` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
