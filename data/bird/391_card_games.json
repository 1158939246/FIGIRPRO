This requires joining the `cards` and `foreign_data` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <Artifact card> AND <black color> AND <foreign language translation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Artifact card  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `originalType` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`originalType` = 'Artifact'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** black color  \n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `colors` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`colors` = 'B'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** foreign language translation  \n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking for the existence of a corresponding entry in the `foreign_data` table, which we will handle through the join condition.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Artifact card):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`originalType` = 'Artifact'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (black color):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`colors` = 'B'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (foreign language translation):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (selecting names of cards):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`originalType` = 'Artifact' AND `T1`.`colors` = 'B' AND `T2`.`language` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
