The client must have opened an account in the branch with the highest average salary, which is represented by the `A11` column in the `district` table.

Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest average salary branch):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`district_id` = (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` DESC LIMIT 1)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (oldest client):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`client_id` = (SELECT `client_id` FROM `client` ORDER BY `birth_date` ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n* **Main Question (gender of the client):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`gender` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`district_id` = `T3`.`district_id` WHERE `T3`.`district_id` = (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` DESC LIMIT 1) AND `T1`.`client_id` = (SELECT `client_id` FROM `client` ORDER BY `birth_date` ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by combining the conditions into a single query without the need for nested sub-queries for the oldest client. We can use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` directly in the main query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
