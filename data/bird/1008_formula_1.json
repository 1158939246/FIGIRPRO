This requires joining the `drivers`, `races`, and `pitStops` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `lap` FROM `pitStops` WHERE <Lewis Hamilton's driverId> AND <2011 Australian Grand Prix raceId>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Lewis Hamilton's driverId\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the `driverId` for Lewis Hamilton from the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `forename` = 'Lewis')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** 2011 Australian Grand Prix raceId\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the `raceId` for the 2011 Australian Grand Prix from the `races` table. The race name can be used to filter the results.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND `year` = 2011)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Lewis Hamilton's driverId):**\n    * **SQL:** `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `forename` = 'Lewis')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (2011 Australian Grand Prix raceId):**\n    * **SQL:** `raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND `year` = 2011)\n\n* **Main Question (lap number):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `lap` FROM `pitStops` WHERE `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `forename` = 'Lewis') AND `raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND `year` = 2011)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships. However, we can simplify it by directly using the subqueries in the `WHERE` clause without needing to nest them.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
