Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide the ID and age of patient with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) between 100-300 index above the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` from the `Patient` table and calculate the `age` based on the `Birthday` column. The `LDH` values are in the `Laboratory` table, and we need to filter for those between 600 and 800.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(`T1`.`Birthday`)) AS `age` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <LDH between 600 and 800>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** LDH between 600 and 800\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `LDH` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`LDH` BETWEEN 600 AND 800\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (LDH between 600 and 800):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`LDH` BETWEEN 600 AND 800\n\n* **Main Question (ID and age of patient):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(`T1`.`Birthday`)) AS `age` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`LDH` BETWEEN 600 AND 800\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
