We will need to join the `expense` table with the `budget` table to filter by the event name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`category`, SUM(`T1`.`cost`) FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_budget` = `T2`.`budget_id` WHERE <event name is 'October Meeting'> GROUP BY `T1`.`category`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event name is 'October Meeting'\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `budget` table to find the `link_to_event` that corresponds to the 'October Meeting'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`link_to_event` IN (SELECT `event_id` FROM `event` WHERE `event_name` = 'October Meeting')\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate the results by expense category.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
