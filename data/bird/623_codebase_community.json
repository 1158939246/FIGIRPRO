This requires joining the `badges` and `users` tables based on `UserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <badge is Supporter> AND <age is greater than 65>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** badge is Supporter\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `badges` table using the `Name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Name` = 'Supporter'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age is greater than 65\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `users` table using the `Age` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Age` > 65\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
