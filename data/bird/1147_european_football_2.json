We will use the `MAX()` function to find this value and then retrieve the corresponding player's name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE `player_fifa_api_id` = (SELECT `player_fifa_api_id` FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE `overall_rating` = MAX(`overall_rating`))\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum overall strength.\n        * **Analysis:** This involves selecting the maximum value from the `overall_rating` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`overall_rating`)\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables to avoid nested queries.
