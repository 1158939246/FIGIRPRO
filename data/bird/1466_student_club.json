Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Write the full name of the club member with the position of 'Secretary' and list which college the club member belongs to.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `first_name` and `last_name` from the `member` table to construct the full name, and we also need to join with the `major` table to get the college information. The filtering condition is based on the `position` column in the `member` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`college` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T1`.`position` = 'Secretary'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** full name\n        * **Analysis:** This involves selecting `first_name` and `last_name` from the `member` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** college\n        * **Analysis:** This involves selecting the `college` from the `major` table, which is linked to the `member` table through `link_to_major`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`college`\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** position = 'Secretary'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `position` column in the `member` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 'Secretary'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (full name):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (college):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`college`\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (position = 'Secretary'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 'Secretary'\n\n* **Main Question (full name and college):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`college` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T1`.`position` = 'Secretary'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
