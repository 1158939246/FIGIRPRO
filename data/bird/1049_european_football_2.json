We need to filter these matches based on the league name and the season.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <matches in 2015/2016 season> AND <matches in Scotland Premier League>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** matches in 2015/2016 season\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `Match` table using the `season` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** matches in Scotland Premier League\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `League` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Scotland Premier League'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (matches in 2015/2016 season):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (matches in Scotland Premier League):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Scotland Premier League'\n\n* **Main Question (count of matches):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`season` = '2015/2016' AND `T2`.`name` = 'Scotland Premier League'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
