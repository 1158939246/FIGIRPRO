Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name the top 3 drivers and the points they scored in the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the names of the drivers and their corresponding points from the `driverStandings` table, filtered by the race that corresponds to the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix. We will also need to join with the `drivers` table to get the driver names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T2`.`points` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `driverStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <race is the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix> ORDER BY `T2`.`points` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race is the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the `raceId` for the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix from the `races` table. This requires filtering by the race name and year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `name` = 'Chinese Grand Prix' AND `year` = 2017)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race is the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `name` = 'Chinese Grand Prix' AND `year` = 2017)\n\n* **Main Question (top 3 drivers and points):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T2`.`points` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `driverStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T2`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `name` = 'Chinese Grand Prix' AND `year` = 2017) ORDER BY `T2`.`points` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `drivers` and `driverStandings` tables based on their relationship, and we are filtering by the specific race using a subquery.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
