Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How long did it take the user, known by his or her display name 'Zolomon' to get the badge?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the time difference between the date the badge was obtained and the date the user's account was created. This involves joining the `badges` table with the `users` table to get the `CreationDate` for the user with the display name 'Zolomon'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUBTRACT(Date, CreationDate) FROM badges AS T1 INNER JOIN users AS T2 ON T1.UserId = T2.Id WHERE T2.DisplayName = 'Zolomon'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the badge date\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we will be selecting the `Date` from the `badges` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** T1.Date\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Get the user's account creation date\n        * **Analysis:** We will select the `CreationDate` from the `users` table for the user with the display name 'Zolomon'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** T2.CreationDate\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (badge date):**\n    * **SQL:** T1.Date\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (user's account creation date):**\n    * **SQL:** T2.CreationDate\n\n* **Main Question (time taken to get the badge):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUBTRACT(T1.Date, T2.CreationDate) FROM badges AS T1 INNER JOIN users AS T2 ON T1.UserId = T2.Id WHERE T2.DisplayName = 'Zolomon'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `badges` and `users` tables based on the user ID, and we are filtering by the display name directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
