This involves counting the number of badges per user and then selecting the user with the highest count. The `badges` table contains the `UserId` and the `Id` of the badge, while the `users` table contains the `DisplayName`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`DisplayName` FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <user with max badges>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** user with max badges\n        * **Analysis:** We need to group by `UserId` and count the number of badges, then find the maximum count.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`UserId` IN (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) = (SELECT MAX(badge_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(`Id`) AS badge_count FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId`)))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (user with max badges):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`UserId` IN (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) = (SELECT MAX(badge_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(`Id`) AS badge_count FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId`)))\n\n* **Main Question (display name of the user):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`DisplayName` FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`UserId` IN (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) = (SELECT MAX(badge_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(`Id`) AS badge_count FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId`)))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to first calculate the maximum badge count and then join it with the `users` table to get the display name.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
