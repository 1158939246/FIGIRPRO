Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What percentage of legendary frame effect cards that are only available in online game variations?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of cards that are both legendary frame effect cards and only available in online game variations. This involves counting the total number of legendary cards and the number of those that are online only.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage FROM cards WHERE <legendary frame effect cards>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** legendary frame effect cards\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `frameEffects` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `frameEffects` = 'legendary'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (legendary frame effect cards):**\n    * **SQL:** `frameEffects` = 'legendary'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage FROM cards WHERE `frameEffects` = 'legendary'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter for legendary frame effect cards and calculating the percentage in one go.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
