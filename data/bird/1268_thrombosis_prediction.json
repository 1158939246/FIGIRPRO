Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter patients based on the `SM` column from the `Laboratory` table and then find the youngest patients based on their `Birthday` from the `Patient` table. The IDs of these patients will be selected.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal anti-SM> ORDER BY <youngest patients> LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal anti-SM\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters the `SM` column in the `Laboratory` table to exclude 'negative' and '0'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SM` NOT IN ('negative', '0')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** youngest patients\n        * **Analysis:** To find the youngest patients, we will order by `Birthday` in descending order and limit the results to 3.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `T2`.`Birthday` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal anti-SM):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SM` NOT IN ('negative', '0')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (youngest patients):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `T2`.`Birthday` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of the three youngest patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`SM` NOT IN ('negative', '0') ORDER BY `T2`.`Birthday` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The ordering and limiting are also straightforward.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
