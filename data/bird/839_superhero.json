Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In superheroes with weight less than 100, list the full name of the superheroes with brown eyes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter superheroes based on their weight and eye color. The `full_name` is in the `superhero` table, and we will filter by `weight_kg` and the eye color associated with brown eyes.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE <weight less than 100> AND <brown eyes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** weight less than 100\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `weight_kg` column in the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` < 100\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** brown eyes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the eye color ID corresponding to brown eyes from the `colour` table and then filter the `superhero` table based on this ID. This requires a join between the `superhero` and `colour` tables.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Brown')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (weight less than 100):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` < 100\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (brown eyes):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Brown')\n\n* **Main Question (full name of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` < 100 AND `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `T2`.`id` FROM `colour` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Brown')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a direct join condition to filter based on the eye color and a simple condition for weight.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
