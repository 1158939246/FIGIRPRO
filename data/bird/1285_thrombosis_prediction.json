Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** When is the latest patient's medical data recorded? This patient should have an abnormal level of lactate dehydrogenase.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum 'First Date' for patients who have an abnormal level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This requires filtering the `Patient` table for the latest date and checking the `Laboratory` table for the LDH condition.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`First Date`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`LDH` >= 500\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (latest patient's medical data):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`First Date`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`LDH` >= 500\n\n**3.
