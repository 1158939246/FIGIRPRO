Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name the races along with its circuit name and location for F1 races hosted in September 2005. \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the race name, circuit name, and location for races that occurred in September 2005. This requires joining the `races` table with the `circuits` table based on the `circuitId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`name`, `T2`.`location` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE <races in September 2005>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** races in September 2005\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `races` table based on the `date` column to ensure the races occurred in September 2005. This can be done using the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the month and year from the date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%m', `date`) = '09' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) = '2005'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (races in September 2005):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%m', `date`) = '09' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) = '2005'\n\n* **Main Question (races and circuit details):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`name`, `T2`.`location` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE STRFTIME('%m', `T1`.`date`) = '09' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '2005'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `races` and `circuits` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
