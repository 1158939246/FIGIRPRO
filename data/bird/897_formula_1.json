Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name the driver with the most winning. Mention his nationality and what is his maximum point scores.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the driver with the maximum number of wins and also retrieve their full name and nationality. This involves aggregating the wins and points, and then joining with the drivers table to get the required details.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`nationality`, MAX(`T2`.`points`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `constructorStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`constructorId` WHERE <most wins condition> GROUP BY `T1`.`driverId` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`wins`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** most wins condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the wins for each driver and find the maximum. This will be done using the `constructorStandings` table where the wins are recorded.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`wins`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (most wins condition):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`wins`)\n\n* **Main Question (driver details):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`nationality`, MAX(`T2`.`points`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `constructorStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`constructorId` GROUP BY `T1`.`driverId` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`wins`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate the wins and points correctly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
