Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List out the dates that users who are located in Rochester, NY obtained their badges.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `Date` from the `badges` table for users whose `Location` is \"Rochester, NY\" from the `users` table. This requires a join between the `badges` and `users` tables based on `UserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Date` FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <users are located in Rochester, NY>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** users are located in Rochester, NY\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Location` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Location` = 'Rochester, NY'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (users are located in Rochester, NY):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Location` = 'Rochester, NY'\n\n* **Main Question (dates of badge acquisition):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Date` FROM `badges` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Location` = 'Rochester, NY'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `badges` and `users` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
