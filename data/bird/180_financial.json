We will need to join these two tables based on the `district_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <birth date between 1983 and 1987> AND <account branch is in East Bohemia>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** birth date between 1983 and 1987\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied directly to the `birth_date` column in the `client` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`birth_date` BETWEEN '1983-01-01' AND '1987-12-31'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** account branch is in East Bohemia\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `account` table based on the `A3` column, which represents the region. We will check if `A3` equals 'East Bohemia'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A3` = 'East Bohemia'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (birth date between 1983 and 1987):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`birth_date` BETWEEN '1983-01-01' AND '1987-12-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (account branch is in East Bohemia):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`A3` = 'East Bohemia'\n\n* **Main Question (list of clients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`birth_date` BETWEEN '1983-01-01' AND '1987-12-31' AND `T2`.`A3` = 'East Bohemia'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
