This involves two parts: calculating the percentage and selecting the names of the cards in Spanish.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name`, (SUM(CASE WHEN `language` = 'Spanish' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS `percentage` FROM `cards` WHERE <language is Spanish> GROUP BY `name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** language is Spanish\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `language` column in the `foreign_data` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `language` = 'Spanish'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Calculate the percentage\n        * **Analysis:** We will use the `SUM` and `COUNT` functions to calculate the percentage of cards in Spanish.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (SUM(CASE WHEN `language` = 'Spanish' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (language is Spanish):**\n    * **SQL:** `language` = 'Spanish'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (calculate the percentage):**\n    * **SQL:** (SUM(CASE WHEN `language` = 'Spanish' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*))\n\n* **Main Question (percentage of cards in Spanish):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name`, (SUM(CASE WHEN `language` = 'Spanish' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS `percentage` FROM `foreign_data` GROUP BY `name`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already quite efficient. We are using `GROUP BY` to aggregate the results by card name and calculating the percentage in the same query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
