Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide list of patients and their diagnosis with triglyceride (TG) index greater than 100 of the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `Diagnosis` from the `Patient` table and the `TG` from the `Laboratory` table. We will filter the results to include only those patients whose triglyceride index is greater than 300.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Diagnosis`, `T2`.`TG` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <TG > 300>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** TG > 300\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `TG` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`TG` > 300\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (TG > 300):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`TG` > 300\n\n* **Main Question (list of patients and their diagnosis):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Diagnosis`, `T2`.`TG` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`TG` > 300\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
