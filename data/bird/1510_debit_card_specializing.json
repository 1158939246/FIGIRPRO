The total price can be derived from the `Price` column in the `transactions_1k` table. We need to filter these transactions to include only those that occurred at gas stations located in the Czech Republic, which is indicated by the `Country` column in the `gasstations` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`Price`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE <Country = 'CZE'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Country = 'CZE'  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `gasstations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Country = 'CZE'):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n* **Main Question (average total price):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`Price`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `transactions_1k` and `gasstations` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
