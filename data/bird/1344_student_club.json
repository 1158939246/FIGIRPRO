Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (fundraising on 2019/9/14):**\n    * **SQL:** `source` = 'Fundraising' AND `date_received` = '2019-09-14'\n\n* **Main Question (notes of fundraising):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `notes` FROM `income` WHERE `source` = 'Fundraising' AND `date_received` = '2019-09-14'\n\n**3.
