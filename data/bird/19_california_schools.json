This requires a join between the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on the `cds` and `CDSCode` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Phone` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <highest average score in Math>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest average score in Math\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `satscores` table to find the maximum value of `AvgScrMath`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`AvgScrMath` = (SELECT MAX(`AvgScrMath`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest average score in Math):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`AvgScrMath` = (SELECT MAX(`AvgScrMath`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n* **Main Question (phone number of the school):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Phone` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T1`.`AvgScrMath` = (SELECT MAX(`AvgScrMath`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
