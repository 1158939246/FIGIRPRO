This requires joining the `posts` table to get the post with 1910 view counts and then counting the comments from the `comments` table associated with that post.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`C`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE <post has 1910 view counts>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** post has 1910 view counts\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `ViewCount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`ViewCount` = 1910\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (post has 1910 view counts):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`ViewCount` = 1910\n\n* **Main Question (count of comments):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`C`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE `P`.`ViewCount` = 1910\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `comments` and `posts` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
