Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all patients who were born in 1937 whose total cholesterol was beyond the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select patient information based on two conditions: the year of birth and the total cholesterol level. The `Patient` table contains the `birthday` column, and the `Laboratory` table contains the `T-CHO` column for cholesterol levels. We will need to join these two tables on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`ID`, `T2`.`birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T1`.`ID` WHERE <born in 1937> AND <total cholesterol beyond normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born in 1937\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `birthday` column using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`birthday`) = '1937'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** total cholesterol beyond normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `T-CHO` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`T-CHO` >= 250\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born in 1937):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`birthday`) = '1937'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total cholesterol beyond normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`T-CHO` >= 250\n\n* **Main Question (list of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`ID`, `T2`.`birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T1`.`ID` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`birthday`) = '1937' AND `T1`.`T-CHO` >= 250\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
