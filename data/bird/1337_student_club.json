To filter the budgets related to the \"October Speaker\" event, we need to join the `budget` table with the `event` table using the `link_to_event` foreign key.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`amount`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <event_name = 'October Speaker'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event_name = 'October Speaker'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `event_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'October Speaker'\n\n**2.
