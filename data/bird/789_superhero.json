They may act in their own self-interest or make decisions based on their own moral code.

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find the average weight of the heroes who are aliens.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate the average weight of heroes, which is represented by the `weight_kg` column in the `superhero` table. We need to filter the data to only include heroes whose race is 'Alien', which is found in the `race` table. This requires a join between the `superhero` and `race` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`weight_kg`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <heroes are aliens>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** heroes are aliens\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `race` table using the `race` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Alien'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (heroes are aliens):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Alien'\n\n* **Main Question (average weight of heroes who are aliens):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`weight_kg`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`race` = 'Alien'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
