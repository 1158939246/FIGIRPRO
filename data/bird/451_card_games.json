Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many cards available in paper have a positive starting maximum hand size?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of cards that meet two criteria: they are available in paper and have a positive starting maximum hand size. The relevant columns are `availability` from the `cards` table and `hand` from the `cards` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <available in paper> AND <positive starting maximum hand size>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** available in paper\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `availability` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `availability` LIKE '%paper%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** positive starting maximum hand size\n        * **Analysis:** This filter checks the `hand` column for values greater than 0. Since the example specifies '3', we will check for any positive integer.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `hand` > '0'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (available in paper):**\n    * **SQL:** `availability` LIKE '%paper%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (positive starting maximum hand size):**\n    * **SQL:** `hand` > '0'\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE `availability` LIKE '%paper%' AND `hand` > '0'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause that combines both conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
