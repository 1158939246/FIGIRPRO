Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patients with an abnormal activated partial prothrombin time, how many of them does not have thrombosis?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the distinct patients who have an APTT greater than 45 and a Thrombosis value of 0. This requires filtering the `Laboratory` table for the APTT condition and the `Examination` table for the Thrombosis condition. We will also ensure that we only count distinct patients.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal APTT> AND <no thrombosis>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal APTT\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `APTT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`APTT` > 45\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** no thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `Examination` table using the `Thrombosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal APTT):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`APTT` > 45\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (no thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`APTT` > 45 AND `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The use of `DISTINCT` ensures that we only count unique patients.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
