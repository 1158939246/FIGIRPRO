This requires joining the `users` table with the `badges` table based on the `UserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`Id`) FROM `users` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `badges` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`UserId` WHERE <users are from India> AND <badge is Teacher>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** users are from India\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Location` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Location` = 'India'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** badge is Teacher\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `Name` column in the `badges` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Name` = 'Teacher'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
