We will filter the data based on the race date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(driverId WHERE time IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(driverId)) * 100 AS completion_rate FROM results WHERE <race date condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race date condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results based on the race date, which requires joining the `results` table with the `races` table to access the date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '1983-07-16')\n\n**2.
