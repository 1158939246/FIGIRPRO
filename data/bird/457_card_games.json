This requires filtering the `cards` table based on the `promoTypes` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `purchaseUrls` FROM `cards` WHERE <promoTypes = 'bundle'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** promoTypes = 'bundle'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `promoTypes` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `promoTypes` = 'bundle'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (promoTypes = 'bundle'):**\n    * **SQL:** `promoTypes` = 'bundle'\n\n* **Main Question (websites to purchase):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `purchaseUrls` FROM `cards` WHERE `promoTypes` = 'bundle'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `cards` table based on the `promoTypes` column.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
