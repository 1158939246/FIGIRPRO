Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the most expensive item that was spent in support of club events?\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the maximum cost of an item, which can be obtained using the `MAX()` function on the `cost` column in the `expense` table. We need to ensure that we are only considering expenses related to club events.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`cost`) FROM `expense` WHERE <expenses related to club events>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** expenses related to club events\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the expenses based on the `expense_description` column to ensure they are related to club events. Since the question does not specify exact keywords, we will assume that any expense description that is not NULL is related to club events.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `expense_description` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (expenses related to club events):**\n    * **SQL:** `expense_description` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (most expensive item):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`cost`) FROM `expense` WHERE `expense_description` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already quite efficient. We are using the `MAX()` function directly on the `cost` column while filtering for non-null `expense_description`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
