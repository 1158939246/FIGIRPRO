This requires us to join the `budget` table with the `event` table to filter by the event name and then sum the `amount`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`amount`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'September Speaker'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
