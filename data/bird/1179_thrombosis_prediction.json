This requires joining the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on the patient ID and filtering by the diagnosis and examination date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`aCL IgM` FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <diagnosis is SLE> AND <diagnosis date is 1994/2/19> AND <examination date is 1993/11/12>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** diagnosis is SLE\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** diagnosis date is 1994/2/19\n        * **Analysis:** This refers to the `Description` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Description` = '1994-02-19'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** examination date is 1993/11/12\n        * **Analysis:** This refers to the `Examination Date` column in the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Examination Date` = '1993-11-12'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (diagnosis is SLE):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (diagnosis date is 1994/2/19):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Description` = '1994-02-19'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (examination date is 1993/11/12):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Examination Date` = '1993-11-12'\n\n* **Main Question (anti-Cardiolipin antibody concentration):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`aCL IgM` FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE' AND `T2`.`Description` = '1994-02-19' AND `T1`.`Examination Date` = '1993-11-12'\n\n**3.
