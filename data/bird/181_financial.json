Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please provide the IDs of the 3 female clients with the largest loans.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the IDs of clients who are female and have the largest loan amounts. This requires joining the `client` and `loan` tables based on `client_id` and `account_id`, respectively. We will then filter for female clients and order the results by loan amount in descending order, limiting the output to the top 3.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `loan` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <gender is female> ORDER BY <loan amount> DESC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** gender is female\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `client` table using the `gender` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`gender` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** order by loan amount\n        * **Analysis:** We will order the results based on the `amount` column in the `loan` table in descending order.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`amount` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (gender is female):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`gender` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (order by loan amount):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`amount` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of female clients with largest loans):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `loan` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`gender` = 'F' ORDER BY `T2`.`amount` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause is correctly applied to sort the loans in descending order.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
