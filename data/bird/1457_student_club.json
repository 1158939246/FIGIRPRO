Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Give the full name and contact number of members who had to spend more than average on each expense.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone` of members from the `member` table who have expenses greater than the average expense amount from the `expense` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T1`.`phone` FROM `member` AS `T1` WHERE <spent more than average on each expense>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** spent more than average on each expense\n        * **Analysis:** This requires calculating the average cost from the `expense` table and filtering members based on their expenses. We will join the `member` table with the `expense` table using the `link_to_member` foreign key.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`link_to_member` IN (SELECT `link_to_member` FROM `expense` WHERE `cost` > (SELECT AVG(`cost`) FROM `expense`))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (spent more than average on each expense):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`link_to_member` IN (SELECT `link_to_member` FROM `expense` WHERE `cost` > (SELECT AVG(`cost`) FROM `expense`))\n\n* **Main Question (full name and contact number):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T1`.`phone` FROM `member` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`link_to_member` IN (SELECT `link_to_member` FROM `expense` WHERE `cost` > (SELECT AVG(`cost`) FROM `expense`))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `member` and `expense` tables and applying the condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
