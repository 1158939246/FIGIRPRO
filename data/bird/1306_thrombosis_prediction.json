The relevant data is in the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables, which we will join based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <diagnosed with SLE> AND <normal WBC level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** diagnosed with SLE\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal WBC level\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `WBC` column, which must be between 3.5 and 9.0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 9.0\n\n**2.
