Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the publisher for Hawkman, Karate Kid and Speedy?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `publisher_name` for the superheroes named Hawkman, Karate Kid, and Speedy. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `publisher` table based on the `publisher_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`publisher_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <superhero names>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** superhero names\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to include only the superheroes with the names 'Hawkman', 'Karate Kid', and 'Speedy'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`superhero_name` IN ('Hawkman', 'Karate Kid', 'Speedy')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (superhero names):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`superhero_name` IN ('Hawkman', 'Karate Kid', 'Speedy')\n\n* **Main Question (publisher names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`publisher_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` IN ('Hawkman', 'Karate Kid', 'Speedy')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `publisher` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
