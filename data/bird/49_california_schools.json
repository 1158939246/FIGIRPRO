Please provide the name of each school as well as the closure date.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of closed schools grouped by county. The `schools` table contains the `StatusType`, `County`, `School`, and `ClosedDate` columns. We will filter for schools that are closed and then group by county to find the one with the most closed schools.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `County`, `School`, `ClosedDate` FROM `schools` WHERE <schools are closed> GROUP BY `County` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** schools are closed\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `StatusType` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `StatusType` = 'Closed'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (schools are closed):**\n    * **SQL:** `StatusType` = 'Closed'\n\n* **Main Question (count of closed schools by county):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `County`, `School`, `ClosedDate` FROM `schools` WHERE `StatusType` = 'Closed' GROUP BY `County` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 needs to be adjusted to ensure we get the names of each school and their closure dates for the county with the most closed schools. We can achieve this by using a subquery to first determine the county with the most closed schools and then join back to the `schools` table to get the relevant details.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
