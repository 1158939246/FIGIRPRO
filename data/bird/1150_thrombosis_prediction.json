This involves two counts: the count of female patients born after 1930 and the total count of female patients. We will use the `COUNT(ID)` function for both counts.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`ID` WHERE <born after 1930 and female>) * 100.0 / COUNT(`ID` WHERE <female>)) AS percentage FROM `Patient`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of female patients born after 1930\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Patient` table for female patients and those born after 1930.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`ID`) WHERE `SEX` = 'F' AND year(`Birthday`) > '1930'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total count of female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward count of all female patients.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`ID`) WHERE `SEX` = 'F'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of female patients born after 1930):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`ID`) WHERE `SEX` = 'F' AND year(`Birthday`) > '1930'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total count of female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`ID`) WHERE `SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`ID`) WHERE `SEX` = 'F' AND year(`Birthday`) > '1930') * 100.0 / COUNT(`ID`) WHERE `SEX` = 'F' AS percentage FROM `Patient`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a single `SELECT` statement with conditional aggregation to avoid multiple scans of the `Patient` table.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
