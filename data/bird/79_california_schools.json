Indicate the amount.  \n**Evidence**: 'Does not offer physical building' means Virtual = F in the database.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Between San Diego and Santa Barbara, which county offers the most number of schools that does not offer physical building? Indicate the amount.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of schools in each county that do not offer a physical building (where `Virtual = 'F'`). We will group the results by county and then determine which county has the highest count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `County`, COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE `Virtual` = 'F' AND `County` IN ('San Diego', 'Santa Barbara') GROUP BY `County` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of schools that do not offer physical building\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward count of schools filtered by the `Virtual` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE `Virtual` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by counties\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to only include schools in San Diego and Santa Barbara.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `County` IN ('San Diego', 'Santa Barbara')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of schools that do not offer physical building):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE `Virtual` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (filter by counties):**\n    * **SQL:** `County` IN ('San Diego', 'Santa Barbara')\n\n* **Main Question (count of schools by county):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `County`, COUNT(*) FROM `schools` WHERE `Virtual` = 'F' AND `County` IN ('San Diego', 'Santa Barbara') GROUP BY `County` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate the counts by county and an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results, ensuring we get the county with the highest count.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
