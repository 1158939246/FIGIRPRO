This requires joining the `users` table with the `badges` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Age` FROM `users` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `badges` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`UserId` WHERE <users located in Vienna, Austria>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** users located in Vienna, Austria\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Location` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Location` = 'Vienna, Austria'\n\n**2.
