The age condition can be calculated using the `birthday` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE <age condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** age condition\n        * **Analysis:** The age condition can be expressed using the `datetime` function to calculate the difference between the current date and the `birthday`. We need to check if this difference is greater than 34 years.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'localtime') - datetime(`birthday`) > 34 * 365.25\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (age condition):**\n    * **SQL:** datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'localtime') - datetime(`birthday`) > 34 * 365.25\n\n* **Main Question (list of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'localtime') - datetime(`birthday`) > 34 * 365.25\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `Player` table based on the calculated age condition.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
