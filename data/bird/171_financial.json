A3 refers to region. Data about no. of committed crimes 1996 appears in A16.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the difference in the number of crimes committed in East and North Bohemia in 1996?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the total number of crimes committed in both regions for the year 1996 and then find the difference. This requires filtering the `district` table based on the region and summing the `A16` column for each region.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') - (SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'East Bohemia') AS crime_difference\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Total number of crimes in North Bohemia in 1996\n        * **Analysis:** We will filter the `district` table for the region 'North Bohemia' and sum the `A16` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total number of crimes in East Bohemia in 1996\n        * **Analysis:** Similarly, we will filter the `district` table for the region 'East Bohemia' and sum the `A16` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'East Bohemia'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total crimes in North Bohemia):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total crimes in East Bohemia):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'East Bohemia'\n\n* **Main Question (difference in crimes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') - (SELECT SUM(A16) FROM district WHERE A3 = 'East Bohemia') AS crime_difference\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses subqueries to calculate the sums directly. There is no need for further optimization since we are directly calculating the difference between two aggregated values.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
