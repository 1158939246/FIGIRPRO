Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all carcinogenic molecules and their elements.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `molecule_id` and `element` for molecules that are carcinogenic. This requires filtering the `molecule` table for those with a `label` of '+' and joining it with the `atom` table to get the corresponding elements.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`molecule_id`, `T2`.`element` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <molecule is carcinogenic>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** molecule is carcinogenic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `molecule` table using the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`label` = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (molecule is carcinogenic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`label` = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (list of carcinogenic molecules and their elements):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`molecule_id`, `T2`.`element` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`label` = '+'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `molecule` and `atom` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
