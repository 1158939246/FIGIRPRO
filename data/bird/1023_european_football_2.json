Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the players with an overall rating between 60 to 65, how many players whose going to be in all of your attack moves instead of defensing?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count players based on two conditions: their overall rating and their defensive work rate. The relevant table for this information is `Player_Attributes`, which contains the `overall_rating` and `defensive_work_rate`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE <overall rating condition> AND <defensive work rate condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** overall rating condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters players based on their overall rating.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `overall_rating` >= 60 AND `overall_rating` < 65\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** defensive work rate condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters players based on their defensive work rate.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `defensive_work_rate` = 'low'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (overall rating condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `overall_rating` >= 60 AND `overall_rating` < 65\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (defensive work rate condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `defensive_work_rate` = 'low'\n\n* **Main Question (count of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE `overall_rating` >= 60 AND `overall_rating` < 65 AND `defensive_work_rate` = 'low'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of players meeting both conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
