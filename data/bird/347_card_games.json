Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the card IDs, ruling texts, and the content warning status for cards illustrated by Stephen Daniele. This requires joining the `cards` and `rulings` tables based on the card's UUID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id`, `T2`.`text`, `T1`.`hasContentWarning` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <artist is Stephen Daniele> AND <has content warning>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** artist is Stephen Daniele\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `artist` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`artist` = 'Stephen Daniele'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** has content warning\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `hasContentWarning` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`hasContentWarning` = 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (artist is Stephen Daniele):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`artist` = 'Stephen Daniele'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (has content warning):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`hasContentWarning` = 1\n\n* **Main Question (retrieve card IDs, ruling texts, and content warning status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id`, `T2`.`text`, `T1`.`hasContentWarning` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`artist` = 'Stephen Daniele' AND `T1`.`hasContentWarning` = 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
