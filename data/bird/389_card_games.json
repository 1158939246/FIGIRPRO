Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List down the name of cards with original types of Creature - Elf and the date of rulings for these cards.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `name` of the cards from the `cards` table and the `date` of rulings from the `rulings` table. The filtering condition is that the `originalType` must be 'Creature - Elf'. This requires a join between the `cards` and `rulings` tables based on the `uuid`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`date` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <originalType is Creature - Elf>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** originalType is Creature - Elf\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `originalType` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`originalType` = 'Creature - Elf'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (originalType is Creature - Elf):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`originalType` = 'Creature - Elf'\n\n* **Main Question (name and date of rulings):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`date` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`originalType` = 'Creature - Elf'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
