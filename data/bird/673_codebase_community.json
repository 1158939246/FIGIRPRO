Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average number of posts voted by the oldest users?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average number of posts voted, which involves the `PostId` from the `votes` table. To find the oldest users, we will need to join the `votes` table with the `users` table based on `UserId` and filter for the oldest users based on the `Age` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`PostId`) FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <oldest users>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** oldest users\n        * **Analysis:** To find the oldest users, we will filter the `users` table for the maximum age. We can use a subquery to get the maximum age and then filter the main query based on that.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Age` = (SELECT MAX(`Age`) FROM `users`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (oldest users):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Age` = (SELECT MAX(`Age`) FROM `users`)\n\n* **Main Question (average number of posts voted):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`PostId`) FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Age` = (SELECT MAX(`Age`) FROM `users`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `votes` and `users` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the oldest users.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
