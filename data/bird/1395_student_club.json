Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many members did attend the event 'Community Theater' in 2019? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of members who attended the specified event. This requires joining the `attendance` table with the `event` table to filter by the event name and date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`link_to_member`) FROM `attendance` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <event is 'Community Theater'> AND <event date is in 2019>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event is 'Community Theater'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `event_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'Community Theater'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** event date is in 2019\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `event_date` column to ensure it falls within the year 2019. We can use the `LIKE` operator to match the date format.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_date` LIKE '2019%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (event is 'Community Theater'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'Community Theater'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (event date is in 2019):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`event_date` LIKE '2019%'\n\n* **Main Question (count of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`link_to_member`) FROM `attendance` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'Community Theater' AND `T2`.`event_date` LIKE '2019%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
