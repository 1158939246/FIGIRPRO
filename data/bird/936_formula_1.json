Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which was the fastest lap for Lewis Hamilton in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the fastest lap time for Lewis Hamilton in a specific race (2008 Australian Grand Prix). This requires us to identify the race first, then find the driver, and finally filter the lap times to get the fastest one.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MIN(`T3`.`time`) FROM `lapTimes` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T1` ON `T3`.`driverId` = `T1`.`driverId` WHERE <Lewis Hamilton> AND <2008 Australian Grand Prix>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Lewis Hamilton\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `drivers` table to find Lewis Hamilton's `driverId`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`forename` = 'Lewis' AND `T1`.`surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** 2008 Australian Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `races` table to find the raceId for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND `T2`.`year` = 2008\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Lewis Hamilton):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`forename` = 'Lewis' AND `T1`.`surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (2008 Australian Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND `T2`.`year` = 2008\n\n* **Main Question (fastest lap):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MIN(`T3`.`time`) FROM `lapTimes` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T1` ON `T3`.`driverId` = `T1`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`forename` = 'Lewis' AND `T1`.`surname` = 'Hamilton' AND `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND `T2`.`year` = 2008\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filters based on the required conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
