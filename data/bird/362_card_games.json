To do this, we first need to find the `uuid` of the card \"Condemn\" from the `cards` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `text` FROM `rulings` WHERE `uuid` = (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Condemn')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the `uuid` of the card \"Condemn\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to filter the `cards` table by the card name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Condemn'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Find the `uuid` of the card \"Condemn\"):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Condemn'\n\n* **Main Question (description about the ruling):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `text` FROM `rulings` WHERE `uuid` = (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Condemn')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses a subquery to find the `uuid` of the card \"Condemn\" and then retrieves the corresponding ruling description.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
