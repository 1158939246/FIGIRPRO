Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the anti Cardiolipin antibody concentration of the female patient with the highest uric acid level in the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the concentrations of the anti Cardiolipin antibodies for the female patient who has the highest uric acid level that is still considered normal (greater than 6.50). This requires filtering by gender, finding the maximum uric acid level, and then retrieving the antibody concentrations for that patient.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `aCL IgG`, `aCL IgM`, `aCL IgA` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`SEX` = 'F' AND `L`.`UA` = (SELECT MAX(`UA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `UA` > 6.50 AND `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Patient` WHERE `SEX` = 'F'))\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest uric acid level in the normal range\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of `UA` from the `Laboratory` table where `UA` is greater than 6.50 and the patient is female.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`UA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `UA` > 6.50 AND `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Patient` WHERE `SEX` = 'F')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** female patient\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest uric acid level in the normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT MAX(`UA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `UA` > 6.50 AND `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Patient` WHERE `SEX` = 'F'))\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (female patient):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Main Question (anti Cardiolipin antibody concentrations):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `aCL IgG`, `aCL IgM`, `aCL IgA` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`SEX` = 'F' AND `L`.`UA` = (SELECT MAX(`UA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `UA` > 6.50 AND `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Patient` WHERE `SEX` = 'F'))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
