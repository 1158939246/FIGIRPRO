Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list top five molecules that have double bonds in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the top five molecules based on their `molecule_id` that have a double bond. The `bond` table contains the `bond_type`, which we will filter for double bonds. We will then join this with the `molecule` table to get the relevant molecule information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`molecule_id` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <double bond> ORDER BY `T2`.`molecule_id` ASC LIMIT 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** double bond\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = ' = '\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (double bond):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = ' = '\n\n* **Main Question (top five molecules):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`molecule_id` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`bond_type` = ' = ' ORDER BY `T2`.`molecule_id` ASC LIMIT 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures the results are sorted alphabetically, and `LIMIT 5` restricts the output to the top five results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
