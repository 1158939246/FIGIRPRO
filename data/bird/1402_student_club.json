Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the most popular size of t-shirt ordered by the club members?\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the most frequently ordered t-shirt size, which can be determined by counting occurrences of each size in the `member` table and selecting the maximum count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `t_shirt_size` FROM `member` GROUP BY `t_shirt_size` ORDER BY COUNT(`t_shirt_size`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of each t-shirt size\n        * **Analysis:** We need to group the data by `t_shirt_size` and count how many times each size appears.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`t_shirt_size`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of each t-shirt size):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`t_shirt_size`)\n\n* **Main Question (most popular t-shirt size):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `t_shirt_size` FROM `member` GROUP BY `t_shirt_size` ORDER BY COUNT(`t_shirt_size`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `GROUP BY` to aggregate the counts of each t-shirt size and `ORDER BY` to sort them in descending order, ensuring we get the most popular size at the top.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
