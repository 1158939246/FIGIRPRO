Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What percentage of male clients request for weekly statements to be issued?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of male clients who requested weekly statements. This involves two counts: the count of male clients who requested weekly statements and the total count of clients who requested weekly statements.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(<male clients who requested weekly statements>) * 100.0 / COUNT(<clients who requested weekly statements>)) AS percentage FROM <relevant tables> WHERE <conditions>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** count of male clients who requested weekly statements\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter clients based on gender and the type of request. This requires joining the `client`, `account`, and `trans` tables to find clients who requested weekly statements.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `client_id`) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T` ON `A`.`account_id` = `T`.`account_id` WHERE `C`.`gender` = 'M' AND `T`.`k_symbol` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** count of all clients who requested weekly statements\n        * **Analysis:** This is similar to sub-question 1 but without the gender filter.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `client_id`) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T` ON `A`.`account_id` = `T`.`account_id` WHERE `T`.`k_symbol` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of male clients who requested weekly statements):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `C`.`client_id`) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T` ON `A`.`account_id` = `T`.`account_id` WHERE `C`.`gender` = 'M' AND `T`.`k_symbol` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of all clients who requested weekly statements):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `C`.`client_id`) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T` ON `A`.`account_id` = `T`.`account_id` WHERE `T`.`k_symbol` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage of male clients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT `C`.`client_id`) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `C`.`client_id`) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T` ON `A`.`account_id` = `T`.`account_id` WHERE `T`.`k_symbol` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE')) AS percentage FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T` ON `A`.`account_id` = `T`.`account_id` WHERE `C`.`gender` = 'M' AND `T`.`k_symbol` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a common table expression (CTE) or subquery to avoid repeating the join logic. However, since we are limited to a single query output, we will keep it as is.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
