A driver is considered to have finished if there is a record of their time in the `results` table. We will need to filter the results based on the race date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `driverId`) FROM `results` WHERE <race date is 2015/11/29> AND <driver finished the race>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race date is 2015/11/29\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `results` table with the `races` table to filter by the race date. The date is stored in the `date` column of the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '2015-11-29')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** driver finished the race\n        * **Analysis:** A driver is considered to have finished if there is a non-null value in the `time` column of the `results` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race date is 2015/11/29):**\n    * **SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '2015-11-29')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (driver finished the race):**\n    * **SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of drivers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `driverId`) FROM `results` WHERE `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '2015-11-29') AND `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
