List out the type of this card.  \n**Evidence**: The question requires us to find the foreign name and type of cards that have a specific watermark, in this case, \"boros\".\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name the foreign name of the card that has boros watermark? List out the type of this card.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `name` from the `foreign_data` table and the `type` from the `cards` table for cards that have a \"boros\" watermark. This requires a join between the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`type` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <watermark condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** watermark condition\n        * **Analysis:** The watermark information is stored in the `cards` table under the `watermark` column. We need to filter for cards that have a watermark of \"boros\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`watermark` = 'boros'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (watermark condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`watermark` = 'boros'\n\n* **Main Question (foreign name and type):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`type` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`watermark` = 'boros'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
