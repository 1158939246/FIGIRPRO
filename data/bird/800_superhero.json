Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the percentage of superheroes with blue eyes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of superheroes whose eye color is blue. This involves two main components: the count of superheroes with blue eyes and the total count of superheroes.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(<count of blue-eyed superheroes>) / COUNT(<total superheroes>)) * 100 AS percentage FROM superhero AS T1 INNER JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE <blue eyes condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** count of blue-eyed superheroes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the superheroes based on their eye color. The condition for blue eyes is that the `colour` table's `colour` column must equal 'Blue'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN T2.colour = 'Blue' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** total count of superheroes\n        * **Analysis:** This is simply the count of all superheroes in the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(T1.superhero_name)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of blue-eyed superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN T2.colour = 'Blue' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total count of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(T1.superhero_name)\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN T2.colour = 'Blue' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(T1.superhero_name)) AS percentage FROM superhero AS T1 INNER JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `superhero` and `colour` tables based on the eye color ID, and we are calculating the percentage directly in the `SELECT` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
