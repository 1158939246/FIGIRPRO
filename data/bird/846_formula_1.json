Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the reference names of the drivers who are eliminated in the first period in race number 20.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `driverRef` of drivers who did not qualify in the first qualifying period (Q1) for race number 20. This involves filtering the `qualifying` table for raceId = 20 and selecting the drivers with the maximum Q1 times.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`driverRef` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`driverId` IN (SELECT `T2`.`driverId` FROM `qualifying` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`raceId` = 20 ORDER BY `T2`.`q1` DESC LIMIT 5)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** drivers who are eliminated in the first qualifying period\n        * **Analysis:** We need to select the `driverId` from the `qualifying` table where `raceId` is 20 and order by `q1` in descending order to get the slowest drivers who did not qualify.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `qualifying` WHERE `raceId` = 20 ORDER BY `q1` DESC LIMIT 5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (drivers who are eliminated in the first qualifying period):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `qualifying` WHERE `raceId` = 20 ORDER BY `q1` DESC LIMIT 5\n\n* **Main Question (reference names of eliminated drivers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`driverRef` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`driverId` IN (SELECT `T2`.`driverId` FROM `qualifying` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`raceId` = 20 ORDER BY `T2`.`q1` DESC LIMIT 5)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to filter the drivers based on their qualifying times in race number 20.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
