Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the total average cost that Elijah Allen spent in the events on September and October.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average cost of expenses incurred by Elijah Allen during the months of September and October. This involves filtering the expenses based on the member's name and the expense date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(cost) FROM expense WHERE <expenses are by Elijah Allen> AND <expenses are in September or October>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** expenses are by Elijah Allen\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `expense` table with the `member` table to filter expenses related to Elijah Allen. This requires matching the `link_to_member` in the `expense` table with the `member_id` in the `member` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** link_to_member = (SELECT member_id FROM member WHERE first_name = 'Elijah' AND last_name = 'Allen')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** expenses are in September or October\n        * **Analysis:** We can filter the expenses based on the `expense_date` column. We will extract the month from the `expense_date` and check if it is either 9 (September) or 10 (October).\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** strftime('%m', expense_date) IN ('09', '10')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (expenses are by Elijah Allen):**\n    * **SQL:** link_to_member IN (SELECT member_id FROM member WHERE first_name = 'Elijah' AND last_name = 'Allen')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (expenses are in September or October):**\n    * **SQL:** strftime('%m', expense_date) IN ('09', '10')\n\n* **Main Question (average cost):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(cost) FROM expense WHERE link_to_member IN (SELECT member_id FROM member WHERE first_name = 'Elijah' AND last_name = 'Allen') AND strftime('%m', expense_date) IN ('09', '10')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `INNER JOIN` to filter the expenses based on the member's name and the date filtering is done directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
