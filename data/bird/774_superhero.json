We will need to select the `race` from the `race` table by joining it with the `superhero` table based on the `race_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'A-Bomb'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the superhero A-Bomb\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superhero` table using the `superhero_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'A-Bomb'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `race` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
