Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Enumerate the bond ID of triple bond type molecules and tell me if they are carcinogenic or not. \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `bond_id` from the `bond` table where the `bond_type` is a triple bond ('#'). Additionally, we need to check the carcinogenic status of the corresponding molecule from the `molecule` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`bond_id`, `T2`.`label` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <bond type is triple> \n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bond type is triple\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bond type is triple):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n* **Main Question (bond ID and carcinogenic status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`bond_id`, `T2`.`label` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `bond` and `molecule` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
