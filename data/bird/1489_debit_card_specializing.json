This requires joining the `customers`, `yearmonth`, and `transactions_1k` tables to filter by the KAM segment and the specified date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Segment` = 'KAM' AND `T1`.`Date` = '201305'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (total consumption):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Segment` = 'KAM' AND `T1`.`Date` = '201305'\n\n**3.
