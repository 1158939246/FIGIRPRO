Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the sets in the block \"Ice Age\", how many of them have an Italian translation?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of sets that belong to the block \"Ice Age\" and have an Italian translation. This requires joining the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table based on the `setCode`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <sets in the block \"Ice Age\"> AND <Italian translation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** sets in the block \"Ice Age\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `block` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`block` = 'Ice Age'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Italian translation\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `set_translations` table for entries where the `language` is 'Italian' and the `translation` is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (sets in the block \"Ice Age\"):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`block` = 'Ice Age'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Italian translation):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of sets):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T1`.`block` = 'Ice Age' AND `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
