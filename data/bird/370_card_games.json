Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many borderless cards are illustrated in Russian? \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of cards that are borderless and illustrated in Russian. We need to filter the `cards` table for `borderColor = 'borderless'` and join it with the `foreign_data` table to check for the language being 'Russian'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`uuid`) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <borderless condition> AND <language condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** borderless condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `borderColor` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`borderColor` = 'borderless'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** language condition\n        * **Analysis:** This filter checks the `language` column in the `foreign_data` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Russian'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (borderless condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`borderColor` = 'borderless'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (language condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Russian'\n\n* **Main Question (count of borderless cards in Russian):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`uuid`) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`borderColor` = 'borderless' AND `T2`.`language` = 'Russian'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
