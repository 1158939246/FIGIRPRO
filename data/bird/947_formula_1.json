We will need to filter the `drivers` table based on nationality and date of birth.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `drivers` WHERE <British drivers> AND <born after 1980>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** British drivers\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `drivers` table based on the `nationality` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `nationality` = 'British'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** born after 1980\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `dob` column to include only those dates after January 1, 1981.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `dob` > '1980-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (British drivers):**\n    * **SQL:** `nationality` = 'British'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (born after 1980):**\n    * **SQL:** `dob` > '1980-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (count of British drivers born after 1980):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `drivers` WHERE `nationality` = 'British' AND `dob` > '1980-12-31'\n\n**3.
