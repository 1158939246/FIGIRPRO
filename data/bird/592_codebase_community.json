Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many users are awarded with more than 5 badges?\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for a count of users who have more than 5 badges. We will need to aggregate the badge counts by `UserId` and filter those counts to find users with more than 5 badges.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `UserId`) FROM `badges` WHERE <Count of badges > 5>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** Count of badges > 5\n        * **Analysis:** We need to group the badges by `UserId` and count the number of badges for each user. Then we will filter to only include users with a count greater than 5.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) > 5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (Count of badges > 5):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) > 5\n\n* **Main Question (count of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `UserId`) FROM (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) > 5)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly counting the distinct `UserId` from the `badges` table where the count of badges is greater than 5.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
