This requires joining the `member` table with the `major` table based on the `link_to_major` foreign key.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`major_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T1`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** position of Student Club\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `member` table where we select rows with the `position` equal to 'Vice President'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (position of Student Club):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n* **Main Question (name of major):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`major_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T1`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
