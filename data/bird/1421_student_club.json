We need to count the number of members whose position is 'Member' and whose major is 'Business', and divide that by the total count of members.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(<members who are Business>) / COUNT(<total members>)) * 100 AS percentage FROM member AS T1 INNER JOIN major AS T2 ON T1.link_to_major = T2.major_id\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** members who are major Business\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the members based on their position and major. This will involve checking the `position` column in the `member` table and the `major_name` column in the `major` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN T1.position = 'Member' AND T2.major_name = 'Business' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** total members\n        * **Analysis:** This is simply the count of all members in the `member` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(T1.member_id)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (members who are major Business):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN T1.position = 'Member' AND T2.major_name = 'Business' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total members):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(T1.member_id)\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN T1.position = 'Member' AND T2.major_name = 'Business' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(T1.member_id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM member AS T1 INNER JOIN major AS T2 ON T1.link_to_major = T2.major_id\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the calculations are straightforward.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
