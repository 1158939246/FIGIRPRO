This requires filtering the `trans` table for transactions greater than 10,000 and then joining with the `account` table to get the corresponding district information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`district_id` FROM `trans` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <transaction amount > 10000 AND <transaction year = 1997>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** transaction amount > 10000\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `amount` column in the `trans` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`amount` > 10000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** transaction year = 1997\n        * **Analysis:** We need to extract the year from the `date` column in the `trans` table using the `STRFTIME()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '1997'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (transaction amount > 10000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`amount` > 10000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (transaction year = 1997):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '1997'\n\n* **Main Question (districts with transactions):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`district_id` FROM `trans` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`amount` > 10000 AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '1997'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `trans` and `account` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
