The `Patient` table contains the `ID`, and the `Examination` table contains the `Thrombosis` and `aCL IgM` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <no thrombosis> AND <abnormal CPK>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** no thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table using the `Thrombosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** abnormal level of creatinine phosphokinase\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `Laboratory` table using the `CPK` column. We need to ensure that the `CPK` value is less than 250.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`CPK` < 250\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (no thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (abnormal level of creatinine phosphokinase):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`CPK` < 250\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T3`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0 AND `T3`.`CPK` < 250\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
