Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the full name of all the members of the Student_Club who attended the \"Laugh Out Loud\" event.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `first_name` and `last_name` of members who attended a specific event. This requires joining the `attendance`, `event`, and `member` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`first_name`, `T3`.`last_name` FROM `attendance` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T3`.`member_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'Laugh Out Loud'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the event \"Laugh Out Loud\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `event_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'Laugh Out Loud'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (event name):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'Laugh Out Loud'\n\n* **Main Question (full names of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`first_name`, `T3`.`last_name` FROM `attendance` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T3`.`member_id` WHERE `T2`.`event_name` = 'Laugh Out Loud'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
