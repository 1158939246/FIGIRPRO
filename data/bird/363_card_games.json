Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many cards of legalities whose status is restricted are found in a starter deck?\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of cards that meet two criteria: they have a legality status of 'restricted' and they are found in a starter deck. The relevant tables are `legalities` and `cards`, which we will need to join based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `legalities` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <status is restricted> AND <is found in starter deck>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** status is restricted\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `legalities` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`status` = 'restricted'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** is found in starter deck\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `cards` table using the `isStarter` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`isStarter` = 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (status is restricted):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`status` = 'restricted'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (is found in starter deck):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`isStarter` = 1\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `legalities` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`status` = 'restricted' AND `T2`.`isStarter` = 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
