We will filter the results based on the `releaseDate` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `code` FROM `sets` WHERE <release date is 07/13/2007>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** release date is 07/13/2007\n        * **Analysis:** This involves a straightforward filter on the `releaseDate` column in the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `releaseDate` = '2007-07-13'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (release date is 07/13/2007):**\n    * **SQL:** `releaseDate` = '2007-07-13'\n\n* **Main Question (set code):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `code` FROM `sets` WHERE `releaseDate` = '2007-07-13'\n\n**3.
