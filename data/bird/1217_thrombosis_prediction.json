Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all patients born in 1982, state if their albumin is within normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to check the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table for the year 1982 and the `ALB` column in the `Laboratory` table to see if it falls within the normal range (3.5 to 5.5). We will join the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`Birthday`, `T2`.`ALB` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <patients born in 1982> AND <albumin is within normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** patients born in 1982\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied directly to the `Birthday` column using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) = '1982'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** albumin is within normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking the `ALB` column in the `Laboratory` table to see if it falls between 3.5 and 5.5.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ALB` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patients born in 1982):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) = '1982'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (albumin is within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ALB` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5.5\n\n* **Main Question (patients and their albumin status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`Birthday`, `T2`.`ALB` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) = '1982' AND `T2`.`ALB` BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
