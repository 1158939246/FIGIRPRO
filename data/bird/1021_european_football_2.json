Indicate his name.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum height from the `Player` table and also retrieve the name of the player with that height. This requires using the `MAX()` function on the `height` column and joining it with the `player_name` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name`, MAX(`T1`.`height`) FROM `Player` AS `T1` WHERE <condition for tallest player>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** condition for tallest player\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the player whose height matches the maximum height found in the `Player` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`height` = (SELECT MAX(`height`) FROM `Player`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (condition for tallest player):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`height` = (SELECT MAX(`height`) FROM `Player`)\n\n* **Main Question (height and name of the tallest player):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name`, MAX(`T1`.`height`) FROM `Player` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`height` = (SELECT MAX(`height`) FROM `Player`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a `GROUP BY` clause to ensure we only get the player name corresponding to the maximum height.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
