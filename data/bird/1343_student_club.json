This requires us to first identify the maximum budget amount for \"Food\" and then retrieve the remaining amount associated with that budget.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `remaining` FROM `budget` WHERE `amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `budget` WHERE `category` = 'Food')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum budget amount for \"Food\".  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation query that filters the `budget` table by the category \"Food\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `budget` WHERE `category` = 'Food'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum budget amount for \"Food\"):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `budget` WHERE `category` = 'Food'\n\n* **Main Question (remaining of the biggest budget for \"Food\"):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `remaining` FROM `budget` WHERE `amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `budget` WHERE `category` = 'Food')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the maximum budget amount for \"Food\" and then using that result to filter the `budget` table for the corresponding remaining amount.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
