This requires filtering the `Laboratory` table for blood glucose levels and joining it with the `Examination` table to check for thrombosis.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal blood glucose> AND <no thrombosis>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal blood glucose\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `GLU` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`GLU` < 180\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** no thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `Thrombosis` column in the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal blood glucose):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`GLU` < 180\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (no thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`GLU` < 180 AND `T2`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
