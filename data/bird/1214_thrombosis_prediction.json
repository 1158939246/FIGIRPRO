Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List ID, sex and date of birth of patient whose total protein (TP) below the lower range of the normal index.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID`, `SEX`, and `Birthday` of patients from the `Patient` table where the `TP` value from the `Laboratory` table is below 6.0. This requires a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <TP < 6.0>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** TP < 6.0\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `Laboratory` table using the `TP` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (TP < 6.0):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n* **Main Question (selecting ID, SEX, and Birthday):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
