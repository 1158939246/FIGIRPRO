This involves filtering by the `artist` column and checking that both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <designed by Aaron Miller> AND <are incredibly powerful>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** designed by Aaron Miller\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `artist` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `artist` = 'Aaron Miller'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** are incredibly powerful\n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking that both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2.
