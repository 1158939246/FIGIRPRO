Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the ratio of the schools located in the county of Colusa against the school located in the county of Humboldt?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of schools in Colusa and Humboldt, and then calculate the ratio of these counts. Both counts will be filtered by the condition that the mailing state is California.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' THEN 1 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Humboldt' THEN 1 END)) AS ratio FROM schools WHERE MailState = 'CA'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of schools in Colusa\n        * **Analysis:** We will count the schools where the county is Colusa and the mailing state is California.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' THEN 1 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of schools in Humboldt\n        * **Analysis:** We will count the schools where the county is Humboldt and the mailing state is California.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Humboldt' THEN 1 END)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of schools in Colusa):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of schools in Humboldt):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Humboldt' THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Main Question (ratio of counts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' THEN 1 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Humboldt' THEN 1 END)) AS ratio FROM schools WHERE MailState = 'CA'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using conditional counting within a single query to calculate the ratio directly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
