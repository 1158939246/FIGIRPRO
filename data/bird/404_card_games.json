Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Indicates the name of all the languages into which the set whose number of cards is 309 is translated.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the languages associated with a specific set code that has a base set size of 309. This involves joining the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`language` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <base set size = 309>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** base set size = 309\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `baseSetSize` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`baseSetSize` = 309\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (base set size = 309):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`baseSetSize` = 309\n\n* **Main Question (languages of the set):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`language` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T1`.`baseSetSize` = 309\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
