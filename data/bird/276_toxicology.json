Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Write down the atom IDs of the first and second atoms of triple bond type molecules.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `atom_id` (first atom) and `atom_id2` (second atom) from the `connected` table where the corresponding bond type in the `bond` table is a triple bond (`bond_type = '#'`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`atom_id`, `T2`.`atom_id2` FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` WHERE <bond type is triple>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bond type is triple\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `bond` table using the `bond_type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bond type is triple):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n* **Main Question (atom IDs of first and second atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`atom_id`, `T2`.`atom_id2` FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` WHERE `T2`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `connected` and `bond` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
