Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the cards with converted mana cost higher than 5 in the set Coldsnap, how many of them have unknown power?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the cards that meet two criteria: they belong to the set \"Coldsnap\" and have a converted mana cost greater than 5. Additionally, we need to filter for cards that have unknown power.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE <converted mana cost > 5> AND <set is Coldsnap> AND <unknown power>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** converted mana cost > 5\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `convertedManaCost` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`convertedManaCost` > 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** set is Coldsnap\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `sets` table for the name \"Coldsnap\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** unknown power\n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking if the `power` column is either NULL or has a specific value indicating unknown power (in this case, '*').\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`power` IS NULL OR `T1`.`power` = '*'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (converted mana cost > 5):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`convertedManaCost` > 5\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (set is Coldsnap):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (unknown power):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`power` IS NULL OR `T1`.`power` = '*'\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T1`.`convertedManaCost` > 5 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap' AND (`T1`.`power` IS NULL OR `T1`.`power` = '*')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `cards` and `sets` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
