List down their name.  \n**Evidence**: tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves refers to attacking_work_rate = 'high';\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Who are the players that tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves? \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for the names of players with a high attacking work rate. This information is stored in the `Player` table, specifically in the `attacking_work_rate` column. We will filter for players where `attacking_work_rate` is 'high'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <attacking work rate is high>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** attacking work rate is high\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `attacking_work_rate` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`attacking_work_rate` = 'high'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (attacking work rate is high):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`attacking_work_rate` = 'high'\n\n* **Main Question (players with high attacking work rate):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`attacking_work_rate` = 'high'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
