Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients who have a normal platelet level, how many of them have other symptoms observed?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who meet two criteria: they have a normal platelet level and their diagnosis is not null. The `PLT` column is in the `Laboratory` table, and the `Diagnosis` column is in the `Examination` table. We will need to join these tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal platelet level> AND <Diagnosis is not null>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal platelet level\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `PLT` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` > 100 AND `T1`.`PLT` < 400\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Diagnosis is not null\n        * **Analysis:** This is a simple condition on the `Diagnosis` column in the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Diagnosis` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal platelet level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` > 100 AND `T1`.`PLT` < 400\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Diagnosis is not null):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Diagnosis` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`PLT` > 100 AND `T1`.`PLT` < 400 AND `T2`.`Diagnosis` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
