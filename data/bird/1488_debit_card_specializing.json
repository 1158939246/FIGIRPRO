How much did it consume?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the customer with the highest total consumption. This requires filtering customers by the segment 'KAM' and summing their consumption from the `yearmonth` table. We will then order the results to find the maximum.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `CustomerID`, SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE <segment is KAM> GROUP BY `CustomerID` ORDER BY SUM(`Consumption`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** segment is KAM\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table using the `Segment` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Segment` = 'KAM'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (segment is KAM):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Segment` = 'KAM'\n\n* **Main Question (highest consumption):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`CustomerID`, SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Segment` = 'KAM' GROUP BY `T1`.`CustomerID` ORDER BY SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `yearmonth` and `customers` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
