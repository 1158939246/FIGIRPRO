We will use the `COUNT()` function on the `users` table, filtering based on the `Age` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE <users are adults>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** users are adults\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `users` table using the `Age` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (users are adults):**\n    * **SQL:** `Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n* **Main Question (count of adult users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE `Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of users that meet the age criteria without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
