Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the expenses that spend more than fifty dollars on average.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average cost of expenses and filter those that exceed fifty dollars. The relevant columns are `cost` from the `expense` table and `expense_description` for the output.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `expense_description` FROM `expense` WHERE <average cost > 50\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** average cost > 50\n        * **Analysis:** This requires calculating the average cost using `SUM(cost)` and `COUNT(expense_id)`. We will group by `expense_description` to get the average for each expense type.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** AVG(`cost`) > 50\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average cost > 50):**\n    * **SQL:** AVG(`cost`) > 50\n\n* **Main Question (list of expenses):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `expense_description` FROM `expense` GROUP BY `expense_description` HAVING AVG(`cost`) > 50\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `GROUP BY` to aggregate the costs by `expense_description` and applying the `HAVING` clause to filter those with an average cost greater than fifty.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
