We will filter by the card name and the language.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name` FROM `set_translations` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`code` = `T3`.`setCode` WHERE <French> AND <card name>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** French\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `set_translations` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`language` = 'French'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** card name\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `cards` table for the card with the name \"Tendo Ice Bridge\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`name` = 'Tendo Ice Bridge'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
