Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide the hair colour of the human superhero who is 185 cm tall.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the hair colour of superheroes that meet two criteria: they are human and their height is 185 cm. The hair colour is linked through the `hair_colour_id` in the `superhero` table to the `colour` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <human superhero> AND <height is 185 cm>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** human superhero\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `superhero` table based on the `race_id` that corresponds to 'human' in the `race` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`race_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `race` WHERE `race` = 'Human')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** height is 185 cm\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `height_cm` column in the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` = 185\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (human superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`race_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `race` WHERE `race` = 'Human')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (height is 185 cm):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` = 185\n\n* **Main Question (hair colour of the superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`race_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `race` WHERE `race` = 'Human') AND `T1`.`height_cm` = 185\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `colour` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
