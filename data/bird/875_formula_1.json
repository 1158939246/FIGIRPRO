This requires joining the `races` table to get the year associated with `raceId` 901.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `url` FROM `seasons` WHERE `year` = (SELECT `year` FROM `races` WHERE `raceId` = 901)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the year of the race with `raceId` 901.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to retrieve the year from the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `year` FROM `races` WHERE `raceId` = 901\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year of the race):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `year` FROM `races` WHERE `raceId` = 901\n\n* **Main Question (season page URL):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `url` FROM `seasons` WHERE `year` = (SELECT `year` FROM `races` WHERE `raceId` = 901)\n\n**3.
