Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the names of all races that occurred in the earliest recorded year and month.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the races that occurred in the earliest year and month. This requires us to first determine the minimum date from the `races` table, extract the year and month from that date, and then filter the races based on these values.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = <earliest year> AND `month` = <earliest month>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** earliest year\n        * **Analysis:** We can find the earliest year by using the `MIN()` function on the `date` column in the `races` table and extracting the year from it.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', MIN(`date`))\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** earliest month\n        * **Analysis:** Similarly, we can find the earliest month by extracting the month from the minimum date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%m', MIN(`date`))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (earliest year):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', MIN(`date`))\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (earliest month):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%m', MIN(`date`))\n\n* **Main Question (names of races):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `races` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) = (SELECT STRFTIME('%Y', MIN(`date`)) FROM `races`) AND STRFTIME('%m', `date`) = (SELECT STRFTIME('%m', MIN(`date`)) FROM `races`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by combining the sub-queries into a single query that calculates the minimum date once and uses it to filter the races.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
