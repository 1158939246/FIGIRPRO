Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the average view count of each post tagged as 'humor' and list the title and the comment of each post.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to join the `posts` table with the `tags` table to filter for posts tagged as 'humor'. We will then calculate the average view count and select the title and comment for each post.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Title`, `T1`.`Text`, AVG(`T1`.`ViewCount`) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `tags` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`ExcerptPostId` WHERE <tagged as 'humor'> GROUP BY `T1`.`Id`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** tagged as 'humor'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `tags` table where we select rows with `TagName` equal to 'humor'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`TagName` = 'humor'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (tagged as 'humor'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`TagName` = 'humor'\n\n* **Main Question (average view count, title, and comment):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Title`, `T1`.`Text`, AVG(`T1`.`ViewCount`) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `tags` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`ExcerptPostId` WHERE `T2`.`TagName` = 'humor' GROUP BY `T1`.`Id`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we get the average view count for each post.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
