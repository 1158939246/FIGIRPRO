Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all the people who paid more than 29.00 per unit of product id No.5, give their consumption status in the August of 2012.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find customers who made transactions for product id No.5 where the price per unit exceeds 29.00. Then, we will retrieve their consumption status from the `yearmonth` table for August 2012.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Consumption` FROM `yearmonth` AS `T3` WHERE `CustomerID` IN (SELECT `T1`.`CustomerID` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` WHERE <price per unit condition> AND <product id condition>) AND <date condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** price per unit condition\n        * **Analysis:** The price per unit is calculated as `Price / Amount`. We need to filter for transactions where this value is greater than 29.00.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Price` / `T1`.`Amount` > 29.00\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** product id condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter transactions for product id No.5.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`ProductID` = 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** date condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the consumption status for August 2012, which corresponds to the `Date` value of '201208' in the `yearmonth` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`Date` = '201208'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (price per unit condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Price` / `T1`.`Amount` > 29.00\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (product id condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`ProductID` = 5\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (date condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`Date` = '201208'\n\n* **Main Question (consumption status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Consumption` FROM `yearmonth` AS `T3` WHERE `CustomerID` IN (SELECT `T1`.`CustomerID` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`Price` / `T1`.`Amount` > 29.00 AND `T1`.`ProductID` = 5) AND `T3`.`Date` = '201208'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to filter customers based on their transactions and then retrieving their consumption status for the specified date.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
