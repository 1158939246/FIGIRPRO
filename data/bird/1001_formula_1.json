The circuit name can be matched with the `name` column in the `circuits` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`year` = 2008 AND `T3`.`circuitId` = (SELECT `circuitId` FROM `circuits` WHERE `name` = 'Marina Bay Street Circuit')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (ranked 1st in q3):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`q3` = (SELECT MIN(`q3`) FROM `qualifying` WHERE `position` = 1)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race held in Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2008):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`year` = 2008 AND `T3`.`circuitId` = (SELECT `circuitId` FROM `circuits` WHERE `name` = 'Marina Bay Street Circuit')\n\n* **Main Question (full name of the racer):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `qualifying` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T2`.`q3` = (SELECT MIN(`q3`) FROM `qualifying` WHERE `position` = 1) AND `T3`.`year` = 2008 AND `T3`.`circuitId` = (SELECT `circuitId` FROM `circuits` WHERE `name` = 'Marina Bay Street Circuit')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filtering based on the required conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
