The relevant columns are in the `schools` table, specifically the `OpenDate` column for the year and the `DOC` column for the district type.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) / 12 FROM `schools` WHERE <schools opened in 1980> AND <under the jurisdiction of Elementary School District>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** schools opened in 1980\n        * **Analysis:** This can be determined by filtering the `OpenDate` column to check if the year is 1980. We can use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `OpenDate`) = '1980'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** under the jurisdiction of Elementary School District\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `DOC` column where we check if it equals 52.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `DOC` = 52\n\n**2.
