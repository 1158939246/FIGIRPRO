Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the language and flavor text of the card that has colorpie watermark? List out the type of this card.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `language`, `flavorText`, and `type` of the card that has a `watermark` of 'colorpie'. The `watermark` is found in the `foreign_data` table, while the `type` is found in the `cards` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`language`, `T1`.`flavorText`, `T2`.`type` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <watermark is colorpie>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** watermark is colorpie\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `watermark` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`watermark` = 'colorpie'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (watermark is colorpie):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`watermark` = 'colorpie'\n\n* **Main Question (language, flavor text, and type):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`language`, `T1`.`flavorText`, `T2`.`type` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`watermark` = 'colorpie'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
