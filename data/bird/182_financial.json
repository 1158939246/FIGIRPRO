Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many male customers who were born between 1974 and 1976 have made a payment on their home in excess of $4000?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of male customers who meet the specified birth date criteria and have made a payment greater than $4000. This involves filtering based on gender, birth date, and payment amount.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `order` AS `O` ON `A`.`account_id` = `O`.`account_id` WHERE <male customers> AND <birth date between 1974 and 1976> AND <payment amount > 4000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male customers\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `client` table using the `gender` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `C`.`gender` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** birth date between 1974 and 1976\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `birth_date` column in the `client` table to include only those born between January 1, 1974, and December 31, 1976.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `C`.`birth_date` BETWEEN '1974-01-01' AND '1976-12-31'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** payment amount > 4000\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `order` table, specifically to the `amount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `O`.`amount` > 4000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male customers):**\n    * **SQL:** `C`.`gender` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (birth date between 1974 and 1976):**\n    * **SQL:** `C`.`birth_date` BETWEEN '1974-01-01' AND '1976-12-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (payment amount > 4000):**\n    * **SQL:** `O`.`amount` > 4000\n\n* **Main Question (count of male customers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `client` AS `C` INNER JOIN `account` AS `A` ON `C`.`district_id` = `A`.`district_id` INNER JOIN `order` AS `O` ON `A`.`account_id` = `O`.`account_id` WHERE `C`.`gender` = 'M' AND `C`.`birth_date` BETWEEN '1974-01-01' AND '1976-12-31' AND `O`.`amount` > 4000\n\n**3.
