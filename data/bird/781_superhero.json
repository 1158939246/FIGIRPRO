Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide the heights of the heroes whose eye colours are amber.  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `height_cm` from the `superhero` table where the `eye_colour_id` corresponds to the colour 'Amber' in the `colour` table. This requires a join between the `superhero` and `colour` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`height_cm` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <eye colour is amber>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** eye colour is amber  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `colour` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Amber'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (eye colour is amber):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'Amber'\n\n* **Main Question (heights of heroes):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`height_cm` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`colour` = 'Amber'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
