Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patient with an abnormal alkaliphophatase level, how many of them are admitted to the hospital?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who have an ALP level of 300 or more and have an admission status of '+'. This requires filtering the `Patient` table based on the `Admission` column and joining it with the `Laboratory` table to access the `ALP` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal ALP level> AND <admitted to the hospital>  \n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal ALP level  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table where we check if `ALP` is greater than or equal to 300.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`ALP` >= 300  \n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** admitted to the hospital  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `Patient` table where we check if `Admission` is equal to '+'.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`Admission` = '+'  \n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal ALP level):**  \n    * **SQL:** `L`.`ALP` >= 300  \n\n* **Sub-question 2 (admitted to the hospital):**  \n    * **SQL:** `P`.`Admission` = '+'  \n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`ALP` >= 300 AND `P`.`Admission` = '+'  \n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
