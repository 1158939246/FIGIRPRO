Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the last name and position of the student that bought pizza on 09/10/2019? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `last_name` and `position` of the member who incurred an expense for pizza on the specified date. This requires joining the `expense` table with the `member` table based on the `link_to_member` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`last_name`, `T2`.`position` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <bought pizza> AND <on 09/10/2019>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bought pizza\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `expense_description` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Pizza'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** on 09/10/2019\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `expense` table using the `expense_date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-09-10'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bought pizza):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Pizza'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (on 09/10/2019):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-09-10'\n\n* **Main Question (last name and position):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`last_name`, `T2`.`position` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Pizza' AND `T1`.`expense_date` = '2019-09-10'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
