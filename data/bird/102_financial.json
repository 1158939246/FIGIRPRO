Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State different accounts who have account opening date before 1997 and own an amount of money greater than 3000USD.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select distinct accounts based on two conditions: the account opening date (from the `account` table) and the balance (from the `trans` table). We will join these two tables on `account_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`account_id` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <account opening date before 1997> AND <balance greater than 3000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** account opening date before 1997\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `date` column in the `account` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`date` < '1997-01-01'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** balance greater than 3000\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `balance` column in the `trans` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`balance` > 3000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (account opening date before 1997):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`date` < '1997-01-01'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (balance greater than 3000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`balance` > 3000\n\n* **Main Question (distinct accounts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`account_id` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `trans` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`date` < '1997-01-01' AND `T2`.`balance` > 3000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
