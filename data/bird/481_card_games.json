Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list all the foreign languages in which the card \"Ancestor's Chosen\" has a flavor text.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the distinct languages from the `foreign_data` table where the `name` matches \"Ancestor's Chosen\" and the `flavorText` is not null. This requires joining the `cards` table to get the card's UUID and then filtering the `foreign_data` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`language` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' AND `T1`.`flavorText` IS NOT NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the UUID of \"Ancestor's Chosen\"\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `cards` table to find the UUID corresponding to the name \"Ancestor's Chosen\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Check for flavor text\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `foreign_data` table where we check if `flavorText` is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`flavorText` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Get the UUID of \"Ancestor's Chosen\"):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Check for flavor text):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`flavorText` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (list of foreign languages):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`language` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' AND `T1`.`flavorText` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
