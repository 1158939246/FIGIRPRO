Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Write the full name of the member who spent money for water, veggie tray and supplies and include the cost of it.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `first_name` and `last_name` of the member from the `member` table and the `cost` from the `expense` table. We will join these tables based on the `link_to_member` column in the `expense` table and the `member_id` in the `member` table. The filtering will be done based on the `expense_description`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name`, `T1`.`cost` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <spent money for water, veggie tray and supplies>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** spent money for water, veggie tray and supplies\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `expense_description` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Water, Veggie tray, supplies'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (spent money for water, veggie tray and supplies):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Water, Veggie tray, supplies'\n\n* **Main Question (full name and cost):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name`, `T1`.`cost` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE `T1`.`expense_description` = 'Water, Veggie tray, supplies'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
