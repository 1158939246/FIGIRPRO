Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which student was able to generate income more than $40?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the full names of students who have generated income greater than $40. The full name is constructed from the `first_name` and `last_name` columns in the `member` table. We will join the `income` table to filter based on the income amount.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE <income more than $40>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** income more than $40\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `income` table using the `amount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`amount` > 40\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (income more than $40):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`amount` > 40\n\n* **Main Question (students generating income):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE `T2`.`amount` > 40\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `income` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
