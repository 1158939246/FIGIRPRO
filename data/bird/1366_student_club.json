This requires joining the `attendance` table with the `member` table to get member details, and filtering by the event name from the `event` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name` FROM `attendance` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <event is October Meeting>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event is October Meeting\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `attendance` records based on the event name, which is found in the `event` table.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filtering based on the event name. There are no unnecessary nested queries or complex conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
