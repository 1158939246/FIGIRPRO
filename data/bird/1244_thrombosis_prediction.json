Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all patients who first came to the hospital after year 1992 with prothrombin time (PT) level that are normal.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select patient records based on two conditions: the year of their first hospital visit and their prothrombin time level. The relevant tables are `Patient` and `Laboratory`, which we will join on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <first came to the hospital after year 1992> AND <PT level is normal>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** first came to the hospital after year 1992\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `First Date` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`First Date`) > '1992'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** PT level is normal\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied to the `PT` column in the `Laboratory` table, where we check if the value is less than 14.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`PT` < 14\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (first came to the hospital after year 1992):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`First Date`) > '1992'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (PT level is normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`PT` < 14\n\n* **Main Question (list of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`First Date`) > '1992' AND `T2`.`PT` < 14\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
