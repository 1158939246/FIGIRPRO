We will need to join the `member` table with the `major` table to filter by the major name 'Environmental Engineering'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`member_id`) FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE <major is Environmental Engineering>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** major is Environmental Engineering  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `major` table using the `major_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`major_name` = 'Environmental Engineering'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (major is Environmental Engineering):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`major_name` = 'Environmental Engineering'\n\n* **Main Question (count of members):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`member_id`) FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`major_name` = 'Environmental Engineering'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
