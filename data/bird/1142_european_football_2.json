We need to filter the `Match` table based on the `season` column and join it with the `League` table to ensure we are only counting games from the Italian Serie A league.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Match` AS `M` INNER JOIN `League` AS `L` ON `M`.`league_id` = `L`.`id` WHERE `L`.`name` = 'Italy Serie A' AND `M`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (count of games):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Match` AS `M` INNER JOIN `League` AS `L` ON `M`.`league_id` = `L`.`id` WHERE `L`.`name` = 'Italy Serie A' AND `M`.`season` = '2015/2016'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Match` and `League` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
