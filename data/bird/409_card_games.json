Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (pre-modern format):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`format` = 'premodern'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ruling text):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`text` = 'This is a triggered mana ability.'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (do not have multiple faces):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`side` IS NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` INNER JOIN `rulings` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T3`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`format` = 'premodern' AND `T3`.`text` = 'This is a triggered mana ability.' AND `T1`.`side` IS NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
