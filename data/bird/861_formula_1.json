The driver's number is stored in the `drivers` table, and we need to filter the `qualifying` table for the specific race and qualifying time.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`number` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T3`.`driverId` WHERE <finished time in Q3> AND <race number>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** finished time in Q3\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `qualifying` table for the specific Q3 time. The time format is `0:01:54`, which can be matched using the `LIKE` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`q3` LIKE '1:54%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race number\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `qualifying` table using the `raceId` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 903\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (finished time in Q3):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`q3` LIKE '1:54%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race number):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 903\n\n* **Main Question (driver's number):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`number` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T3`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`q3` LIKE '1:54%' AND `T1`.`raceId` = 903\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `qualifying` and `drivers` tables based on the driver ID, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
