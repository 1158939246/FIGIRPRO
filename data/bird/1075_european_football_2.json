This requires us to first determine the maximum balance score and then filter players based on this score and their potential.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE <balance is the highest> AND <potential = 61>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** balance is the highest\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum balance score from the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`balance`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** potential = 61\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `potential` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `potential` = 61\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (balance is the highest):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`balance`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (potential = 61):**\n    * **SQL:** `potential` = 61\n\n* **Main Question (list of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE `balance` = (SELECT MAX(`balance`) FROM `Player_Attributes`) AND `potential` = 61\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
