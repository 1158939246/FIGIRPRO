Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (meetings in 2020):**\n    * **SQL:** `type` = 'Meeting' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `event_date`) = '2020'\n\n* **Main Question (average attendance):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(COUNT(`event_id`), COUNT(DISTINCT `event_name`)) FROM `event` WHERE `type` = 'Meeting' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `event_date`) = '2020'\n\n**3.
