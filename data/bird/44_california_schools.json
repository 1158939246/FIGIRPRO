Indicate the city to where the school is situated.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the average writing score from the `satscores` table for the school with the highest number of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater than or equal to 1500. This involves two main steps: first, identifying the school with the highest number of test takers meeting the score criteria, and then calculating the average writing score for that school.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`AvgScrWrite`), `City` FROM `satscores` WHERE <highest number of test takers with scores >= 1500>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest number of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `satscores` table for schools with `NumGE1500` (number of test takers with scores >= 1500) and find the maximum value.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `NumGE1500` = (SELECT MAX(`NumGE1500`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest number of test takers with scores >= 1500):**\n    * **SQL:** `NumGE1500` = (SELECT MAX(`NumGE1500`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n* **Main Question (average writing score and city):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`AvgScrWrite`), `City` FROM `satscores` WHERE `NumGE1500` = (SELECT MAX(`NumGE1500`) FROM `satscores`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
