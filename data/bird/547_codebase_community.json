Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the posts owned by an elder user, how many of them have a score of over 19?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the posts that meet two criteria: they must be owned by users older than 65 and have a score of 20 or more. This requires joining the `posts` table with the `users` table based on the `OwnerUserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <elder users> AND <score over 19>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** elder users\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `users` table where we select users with an age greater than 65.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Age` > 65\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** score over 19\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `posts` table where we select posts with a score of 20 or more.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Score` >= 20\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (elder users):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Age` > 65\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (score over 19):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Score` >= 20\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Age` > 65 AND `T1`.`Score` >= 20\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
