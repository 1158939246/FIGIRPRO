This requires joining the `card` table with the `disp` table to link the credit card to the client.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`type` FROM `card` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`disp_id` = `T2`.`disp_id` WHERE `T2`.`client_id` = 13539\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (type of credit card):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`type` FROM `card` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`disp_id` = `T2`.`disp_id` WHERE `T2`.`client_id` = 13539\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `card` and `disp` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause directly filters for the specified client ID.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
