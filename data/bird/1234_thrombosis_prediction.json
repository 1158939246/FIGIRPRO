Group them by sex and list the patient by age in ascending order.  \n**Evidence**: abnormal white blood cell count refers to WBC <= 3.5 or WBC >= 9.0;\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the patient ID, sex and birthday who has abnormal white blood cell count. Group them by sex and list the patient by age in ascending order.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID`, `SEX`, and `Birthday` from the `Patient` table, but only for patients who have an abnormal white blood cell count as defined in the evidence. We will join the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on `ID` to filter based on the `WBC` values. Finally, we will group by `SEX` and order by age, which can be derived from the `Birthday` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal WBC> GROUP BY `T1`.`SEX` ORDER BY <age>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal WBC\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `WBC` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`WBC` >= 9.0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age\n        * **Analysis:** To calculate age, we can use the `Birthday` column. We will need to extract the year from the `Birthday` and compare it to the current year to determine age.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal WBC):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`WBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`WBC` >= 9.0\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`)\n\n* **Main Question (patient details):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`WBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`WBC` >= 9.0 GROUP BY `T1`.`SEX` ORDER BY STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) ASC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The grouping and ordering are also correctly applied.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
