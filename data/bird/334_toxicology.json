Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the element with the atom ID of TR004_7 in molecule that is not carcinogenic?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `element` associated with the `atom_id` of 'TR004_7' and ensure that the corresponding `molecule` is non-carcinogenic (i.e., has a `label` of '-'). This requires joining the `atom`, `bond`, and `molecule` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`element` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`atom_id` = 'TR004_7' AND `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Find the element for atom ID 'TR004_7'\n    * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward selection from the `atom` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`atom_id` = 'TR004_7'\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Ensure the molecule is non-carcinogenic\n    * **Analysis:** This involves checking the `label` in the `molecule` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Find the element for atom ID 'TR004_7'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`atom_id` = 'TR004_7'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Ensure the molecule is non-carcinogenic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (element of the atom):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`element` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`atom_id` = 'TR004_7' AND `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `atom` and `molecule` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
