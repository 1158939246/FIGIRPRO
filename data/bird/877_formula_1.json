Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all the drivers who finished the game in race No. 872, who is the youngest?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the youngest driver who finished the race. This involves filtering drivers based on the race ID and checking if they finished (i.e., their `time` column has a value). We will then find the maximum date of birth (`dob`) among these drivers.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`dob`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T2`.`raceId` = 872 AND `T2`.`time` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Filter drivers who finished the race\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`raceId` = 872 AND `T2`.`time` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (youngest driver):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`dob`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T2`.`raceId` = 872 AND `T2`.`time` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `drivers` and `results` tables based on the driver ID, and we are filtering for the specific race and ensuring that the drivers finished the race.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
