Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients with an abnormal C-reactive protein don't have their data recorded?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who have a C-reactive protein (CRP) value of '+' and whose `Description` is NULL. This requires filtering the `Examination` table for the CRP condition and joining it with the `Patient` table to check the `Description`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <CRP abnormal> AND <data not recorded>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** CRP abnormal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table where we check if `CRP` is equal to '+'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`CRP` = '+'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** data not recorded\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `Description` in the `Patient` table is NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Description` IS NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (CRP abnormal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`CRP` = '+'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (data not recorded):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Description` IS NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`CRP` = '+' AND `T2`.`Description` IS NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Examination` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
