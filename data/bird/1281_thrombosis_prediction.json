Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients who have an abnormal level of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, when was the youngest of them born?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `Birthday` of the youngest patient with an abnormal level of GOT. This requires filtering the `Laboratory` table for patients with GOT >= 60 and then finding the maximum `Birthday` from the `Patient` table for those patients.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient` WHERE `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `GOT` >= 60)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Patients with abnormal level of GOT\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table where we select rows with `GOT` >= 60.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `GOT` >= 60)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patients with abnormal level of GOT):**\n    * **SQL:** `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `GOT` >= 60)\n\n* **Main Question (youngest patient's birthday):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient` WHERE `ID` IN (SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `GOT` >= 60)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to filter the `Patient` table based on the `Laboratory` table's `GOT` values.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
