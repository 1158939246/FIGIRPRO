State the colour for these cards.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the card names and their associated colors for the specified set code 'OGW'.

Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (set code is OGW):**\n    * **SQL:** `setCode` = 'OGW'\n\n* **Main Question (cards for set OGW):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name`, `colors` FROM `cards` WHERE `setCode` = 'OGW'\n\n**3.
