Find his full name with that points.  \n**Evidence**: the most points scored refers to max(points); Full name of the driver refers to drivers.forename and drivers.surname;\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State the driver with the most points scored. Find his full name with that points.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum points scored and the corresponding driver's full name. The points are stored in the `driverStandings` table, and the driver's name can be found in the `drivers` table. We will need to join these two tables based on the `driverId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`forename`, `T2`.`surname`, MAX(`T1`.`points`) FROM `driverStandings` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <max points condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** max points condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to get the driver with the maximum points. This can be achieved using a subquery to find the maximum points first.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`points` = (SELECT MAX(`points`) FROM `driverStandings`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (max points condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`points` = (SELECT MAX(`points`) FROM `driverStandings`)\n\n* **Main Question (driver with most points):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`forename`, `T2`.`surname`, MAX(`T1`.`points`) FROM `driverStandings` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`points` = (SELECT MAX(`points`) FROM `driverStandings`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly selecting the maximum points and the corresponding driver's name in a single query without needing to use `MAX()` in the `SELECT` clause since we are already filtering for the maximum points.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
