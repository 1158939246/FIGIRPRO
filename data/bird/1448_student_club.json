Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find the name and date of events with expenses for pizza that were more than fifty dollars but less than a hundred dollars.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `event_name` and `event_date` from the `event` table, filtering based on the expenses recorded in the `expense` table. The filtering criteria include the expense description being 'Pizza' and the cost being between 50 and 100.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name`, `T1`.`event_date` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE <expenses for pizza> AND <cost criteria>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** expenses for pizza\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table where we select rows with an `expense_description` of 'Pizza'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`expense_description` = 'Pizza'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** cost criteria\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the expenses based on the cost being greater than 50 and less than 100.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`cost` > 50 AND `T2`.`cost` < 100\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (expenses for pizza):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`expense_description` = 'Pizza'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (cost criteria):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`cost` > 50 AND `T2`.`cost` < 100\n\n* **Main Question (event name and date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name`, `T1`.`event_date` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE `T2`.`expense_description` = 'Pizza' AND `T2`.`cost` > 50 AND `T2`.`cost` < 100\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `event` and `expense` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
