Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many matches were held in the Belgium Jupiler League in April, 2009?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of matches, which can be obtained by counting the `id` column in the `Match` table. We need to filter these matches based on two criteria: they belong to the Belgium Jupiler League and occurred in April 2009.  \n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`id`) FROM `Match` WHERE <matches in Belgium Jupiler League> AND <matches in April 2009>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** matches in Belgium Jupiler League  \n        * **Analysis:** To determine which matches belong to the Belgium Jupiler League, we need to join the `Match` table with the `League` table on `league_id` and filter by the league name.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `league_id` IN (SELECT `id` FROM `League` WHERE `name` = 'Belgium Jupiler League')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** matches in April 2009  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Match` table directly based on the `date` column using the `SUBSTR` function to extract the year and month.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUBSTR(`date`, 1, 7) = '2009-04'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (matches in Belgium Jupiler League):**  \n    * **SQL:** `league_id` IN (SELECT `id` FROM `League` WHERE `name` = 'Belgium Jupiler League')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (matches in April 2009):**  \n    * **SQL:** SUBSTR(`date`, 1, 7) = '2009-04'\n\n* **Main Question (count of matches):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`id`) FROM `Match` WHERE `league_id` IN (SELECT `id` FROM `League` WHERE `name` = 'Belgium Jupiler League') AND SUBSTR(`date`, 1, 7) = '2009-04'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
