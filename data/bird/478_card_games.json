The relevant tables are `sets` for the set name and `cards` for the card number. We will join these tables based on the set code.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE <set name is Coldsnap> AND <card number is 4>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** set name is Coldsnap  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** card number is 4  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `number` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`number` = '4'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
