This requires joining the `transactions_1k` table with the `gasstations` table based on `GasStationID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`TransactionID`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE <price over 1000> AND <gas station in Czech Republic>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** price over 1000\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Price` column in the `transactions_1k` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Price` > 1000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** gas station in Czech Republic\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `Country` column in the `gasstations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (price over 1000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Price` > 1000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (gas station in Czech Republic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n* **Main Question (count of transactions):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`TransactionID`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T1`.`Price` > 1000 AND `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
