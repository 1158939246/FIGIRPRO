This requires a join between the `member` and `major` tables based on the `link_to_major` column in the `member` table and the `major_id` column in the `major` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`position` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`major_name` = 'Business'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (positions of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`position` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`major_name` = 'Business'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
