Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (matches in the 2008/2009 season):**\n    * **SQL:** M.season = '2008/2009'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (matches held in Belgium):**\n    * **SQL:** C.name = 'Belgium'\n\n* **Main Question (count of matches):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Match AS M INNER JOIN Team AS T ON M.home_team_api_id = T.team_api_id INNER JOIN League AS L ON T.league_id = L.id INNER JOIN Country AS C ON L.country_id = C.id WHERE C.name = 'Belgium' AND M.season = '2008/2009'\n\n**3.
