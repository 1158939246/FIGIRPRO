Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average score in writing for the schools that were opened after 1991 or closed before 2000? List the school names along with the score. Also, list the communication number of the schools if there is any.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average writing score for schools based on their opening and closing dates. The `satscores` table contains the writing scores, while the `schools` table contains the opening and closing dates, as well as the school names and phone numbers. We will need to join these two tables based on the school identifiers.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`School`, AVG(`T1`.`AvgScrWrite`), `T2`.`Phone` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <opened after 1991> OR <closed before 2000> GROUP BY `T2`.`School`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** opened after 1991\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter schools based on their opening date, which is found in the `OpenDate` column of the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`OpenDate` > '1991-12-31'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** closed before 2000\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter schools based on their closing date, which is found in the `ClosedDate` column of the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ClosedDate` < '2000-01-01'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (opened after 1991):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`OpenDate` > '1991-12-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (closed before 2000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ClosedDate` < '2000-01-01'\n\n* **Main Question (average writing score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`School`, AVG(`T1`.`AvgScrWrite`), `T2`.`Phone` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T2`.`OpenDate` > '1991-12-31' OR `T2`.`ClosedDate` < '2000-01-01' GROUP BY `T2`.`School`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we get the average score for each school.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
