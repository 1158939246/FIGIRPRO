Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many users whose reputations are higher than 2000 and the number of views is higher than 1000?\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of users based on two conditions: reputation and views. We will use the `COUNT()` function to get the total number of users meeting these criteria.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE <reputation condition> AND <views condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** reputation condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `users` table using the `Reputation` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Reputation` > 2000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** views condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `users` table using the `Views` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Views` > 1000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (reputation condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `Reputation` > 2000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (views condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `Views` > 1000\n\n* **Main Question (count of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE `Reputation` > 2000 AND `Views` > 1000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of users that meet both conditions without any unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
