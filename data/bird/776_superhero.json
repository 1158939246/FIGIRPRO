This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `race` table based on the `race_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name`, `T2`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Charles Chandler'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Retrieve superhero name and race\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we are directly selecting the required columns from the joined tables.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`superhero_name`, `T2`.`race`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by full name\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to only include the superhero with the full name 'Charles Chandler'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`full_name` = 'Charles Chandler'\n\n**2.
