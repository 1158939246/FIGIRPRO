Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all the frame styles and cards Allen Williams worked on and find any banned cards if there are any.  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve two pieces of information: the frame styles (from the `cards` table) and the status of cards (from the `legalities` table) that are associated with Allen Williams. This requires joining the `cards` and `legalities` tables based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`frameVersion`, `T2`.`status` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <artist is Allen Williams> AND <status is Banned>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** artist is Allen Williams  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `cards` table using the `artist` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`artist` = 'Allen Williams'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** status is Banned  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `legalities` table using the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'Banned'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (artist is Allen Williams):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`artist` = 'Allen Williams'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (status is Banned):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'Banned'\n\n* **Main Question (frame styles and banned cards):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`frameVersion`, `T2`.`status` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`artist` = 'Allen Williams' AND `T2`.`status` = 'Banned'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
