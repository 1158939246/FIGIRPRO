                "plan": "**Question**: What is the free or reduced price meal count for ages 5 to 17 in the Youth Authority School with a mailing street address of PO Box 1040?  \n**Evidence**: The question specifies the need to filter by `School Type` for \"Youth Authority School\" and the `MailStreet` for \"PO Box 1040\". The relevant column for the free or reduced price meal count for ages 5 to 17 is `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)`.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the free or reduced price meal count for ages 5 to 17 in the Youth Authority School with a mailing street address of PO Box 1040?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` from the `frpm` table, filtering by `School Type` and `MailStreet`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM `frpm` WHERE <condition for Youth Authority School> AND <condition for mailing street address>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** condition for Youth Authority School\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `School Type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `School Type` = 'Youth Authority School'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** condition for mailing street address\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `MailStreet` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `MailStreet` = 'PO Box 1040'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (condition for Youth Authority School):**\n    * **SQL:** `School Type` = 'Youth Authority School'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (condition for mailing street address):**\n    * **SQL:** `MailStreet` = 'PO Box 1040'\n\n* **Main Question (free or reduced price meal count):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM `frpm` WHERE `School Type` = 'Youth Authority School' AND `MailStreet` = 'PO Box 1040'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `frpm` table based on the specified conditions.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
