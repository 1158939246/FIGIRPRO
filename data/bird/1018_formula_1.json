This requires filtering the `pitStops` table for entries related to Lewis Hamilton and then applying the `AVG()` function on the `milliseconds` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`milliseconds`) FROM `pitStops` WHERE <Lewis Hamilton's pit stops>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Lewis Hamilton's pit stops\n        * **Analysis:** To filter for Lewis Hamilton's pit stops, we need to join the `pitStops` table with the `drivers` table to get the driver ID for Lewis Hamilton. We will use the `driverId` column in the `pitStops` table and filter based on Lewis Hamilton's name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `driverId` IN (SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `forename` = 'Lewis' AND `surname` = 'Hamilton')\n\n**2.
