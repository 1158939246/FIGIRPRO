Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients with normal anti-SM, how many of them does not have thrombosis?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the patients who have normal anti-SM values and do not have thrombosis. This involves filtering based on the `SM` column from the `Laboratory` table and the `Thrombosis` column from the `Examination` table. We will join the `Laboratory` and `Examination` tables on the `ID` column from the `Patient` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE <normal anti-SM> AND <does not have thrombosis>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal anti-SM\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `SM` value is either '-' or '+-'. We will filter the `Laboratory` table for these values.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`SM` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** does not have thrombosis\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `Thrombosis` value is 0. We will filter the `Examination` table for this value.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal anti-SM):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`SM` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (does not have thrombosis):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`SM` IN ('-', '+-') AND `E`.`Thrombosis` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
