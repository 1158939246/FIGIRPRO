The excellence rate is calculated as `NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr`. We will need to filter out any schools with a `NumTstTakr` of zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Phone` FROM `schools` WHERE <top 3 excellence rates>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** top 3 excellence rates\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the excellence rate for each school and then order the results to get the top 3. This will involve a calculation and an ordering step.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `CDSCode`, `NumGE1500` / `NumTstTakr` AS `ExcellenceRate` FROM `satscores` WHERE `NumTstTakr` > 0 ORDER BY `ExcellenceRate` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n**2.
