We will filter based on the `Charter School (Y/N)` column and the `OpenDate` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Phone` FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `frpm` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <charter school condition> AND <open date condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** charter school condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the school is a charter school by filtering on the `Charter School (Y/N)` column in the `frpm` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** open date condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the school was opened after January 1, 2000, using the `OpenDate` column in the `schools` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`OpenDate` > '2000-01-01'\n\n**2.
