The percentage can then be calculated as `(count of premium customers / total customers) * 100`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(<premium customers>) / COUNT(<total customers>)) * 100 AS percentage FROM <customers> WHERE <country is SVK>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** count of premium customers\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `customers` table for those in the \"premium\" segment.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE Segment = 'Premium' AND CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM gasstations WHERE Country = 'SVK')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** count of total customers in SVK\n        * **Analysis:** This requires counting all customers in the `customers` table that are associated with gas stations in \"SVK\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM gasstations WHERE Country = 'SVK')\n\n**2.
