Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the chance creation crossing class for \"Hull City\" on 2010/2/22?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `chanceCreationCrossingClass` from the `Team_Attributes` table, filtering by the team name and the specific date. This requires joining the `Team` table to get the `team_api_id` corresponding to \"Hull City\".\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`chanceCreationCrossingClass` FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`team_long_name` = 'Hull City' AND `T1`.`date` = '2010-02-22 00:00:00'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the team \"Hull City\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team` table using the `team_long_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`team_long_name` = 'Hull City'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Match the date\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table using the `date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`date` = '2010-02-22 00:00:00'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify the team \"Hull City\"):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`team_long_name` = 'Hull City'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Match the date):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`date` = '2010-02-22 00:00:00'\n\n* **Main Question (chance creation crossing class):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`chanceCreationCrossingClass` FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`team_long_name` = 'Hull City' AND `T1`.`date` = '2010-02-22 00:00:00'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
