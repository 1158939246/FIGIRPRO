This requires joining the `cards` table with the `foreign_data` table on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`artist` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <language is Phyrexian>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** language is Phyrexian\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `foreign_data` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Phyrexian'\n\n**2.
