Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many posts were created on 21st July, 2010?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of posts based on the `CreationDate` column in the `posts` table. We need to filter the posts created on the specified date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` WHERE <posts created on 21st July, 2010>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** posts created on 21st July, 2010  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `CreationDate` column to include only those entries that fall within the specified date range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `CreationDate` BETWEEN '2010-07-21 00:00:00' AND '2010-07-21 23:59:59'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (posts created on 21st July, 2010):**  \n    * **SQL:** `CreationDate` BETWEEN '2010-07-21 00:00:00' AND '2010-07-21 23:59:59'\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` WHERE `CreationDate` BETWEEN '2010-07-21 00:00:00' AND '2010-07-21 23:59:59'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient and straightforward. It directly counts the number of posts that meet the specified date criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
