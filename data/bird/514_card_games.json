Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In duels, what are the top 10 cards with the highest unconverted mana cost?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to find the top 10 cards based on their unconverted mana cost, which is represented by the `manaCost` column in the `cards` table. We need to filter the results to only include cards that are in the 'duel' format.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`manaCost` FROM `cards` AS `T1` WHERE <cards in duel format> ORDER BY <highest unconverted mana cost> DESC LIMIT 10\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** cards in duel format\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `format` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`format` = 'duel'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest unconverted mana cost\n        * **Analysis:** We will order the results by the `manaCost` column in descending order to get the highest values.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`manaCost` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (cards in duel format):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`format` = 'duel'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest unconverted mana cost):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`manaCost` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (top 10 cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`manaCost` FROM `cards` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`format` = 'duel' ORDER BY `T1`.`manaCost` DESC LIMIT 10\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a simple `WHERE` clause to filter by format and an `ORDER BY` clause to sort by mana cost. The `LIMIT` clause ensures we only get the top 10 results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
