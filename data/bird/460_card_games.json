This requires joining the `cards` table with the `foreign_data` table based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`artist` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <flavorName = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** flavorName = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `foreign_data` table using the `flavorName` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`flavorName` = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (flavorName):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`flavorName` = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer'\n\n* **Main Question (artist):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`artist` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`flavorName` = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
