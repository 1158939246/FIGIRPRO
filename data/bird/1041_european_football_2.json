Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the teams with normal build-up play dribbling class in 2014, list the names of the teams with less than average chance creation passing, in descending order of chance creation passing.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter teams based on the `buildUpPlayDribblingClass`, the date range for 2014, and then calculate the average chance creation passing to filter teams with below-average passing. Finally, we will select the team names and order them by chance creation passing.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T2.team_long_name \n    FROM Team_Attributes AS T1 \n    INNER JOIN Team AS T2 ON T1.team_api_id = T2.team_api_id \n    WHERE T1.buildUpPlayDribblingClass = 'Normal' \n    AND T1.date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' \n    AND T1.date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00' \n    AND (SELECT AVG(chanceCreationPassing) FROM Team_Attributes WHERE date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00') > T1.chanceCreationPassing \n    ORDER BY T1.chanceCreationPassing DESC;\n    ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for normal build-up play dribbling class\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1.buildUpPlayDribblingClass = 'Normal'`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter for date in January 2014\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `date` column in the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1.date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND T1.date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00'`\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Calculate average chance creation passing\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average chance creation passing for the relevant date range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SELECT AVG(chanceCreationPassing) FROM Team_Attributes WHERE date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00'`\n\n    * **Sub-question 4:** Filter teams with less than average chance creation passing\n        * **Analysis:** This will be done in the main query using the result from sub-question 3.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `AVG(chanceCreationPassing) > T1.chanceCreationPassing`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal build-up play dribbling class):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1.buildUpPlayDribblingClass = 'Normal'`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date in January 2014):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1.date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND T1.date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00'`\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (average chance creation passing):**\n    * **SQL:** `SELECT AVG(chanceCreationPassing) FROM Team_Attributes WHERE date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00'`\n\n* **Main Question (team names with less than average chance creation passing):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T2.team_long_name \n    FROM Team_Attributes AS T1 \n    INNER JOIN Team AS T2 ON T1.team_api_id = T2.team_api_id \n    WHERE T1.buildUpPlayDribblingClass = 'Normal' \n    AND T1.date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' \n    AND T1.date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00' \n    AND (SELECT AVG(chanceCreationPassing) FROM Team_Attributes WHERE date >= '2014-01-01 00:00:00' AND date <= '2014-01-31 00:00:00') > T1.chanceCreationPassing \n    ORDER BY T1.chanceCreationPassing DESC;\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Team_Attributes` and `Team` tables, and the filtering conditions are clearly defined. The average calculation is done in a subquery, which is appropriate for this context.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
