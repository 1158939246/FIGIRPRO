We will filter the results based on the Russian language from the `set_translations` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`code` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`language` = 'Russian' ORDER BY `T1`.`baseSetSize` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Russian language filter\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `set_translations` table to ensure we only consider sets that have a translation in Russian.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Russian'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Maximum base set size\n        * **Analysis:** We will use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the sets by `baseSetSize` in descending order and limit the results to the top one.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`baseSetSize` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**2.
