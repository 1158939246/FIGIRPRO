This requires joining the `users`, `posts`, and `postHistory` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`UserId` FROM `users` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`OwnerUserId` INNER JOIN `postHistory` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`Id` = `T3`.`PostId` WHERE <at least 1000 views> AND <only one post history per post>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** at least 1000 views\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `Views` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Views` >= 1000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** only one post history per post\n        * **Analysis:** We need to group the `postHistory` entries by `PostId` and count them. We will filter for groups that have a count of 1.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`PostId` IN (SELECT `PostId` FROM `postHistory` GROUP BY `PostId` HAVING COUNT(*) = 1)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (at least 1000 views):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Views` >= 1000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (only one post history per post):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`PostId` IN (SELECT `PostId` FROM `postHistory` GROUP BY `PostId` HAVING COUNT(*) = 1)\n\n* **Main Question (users with conditions):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`UserId` FROM `users` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`OwnerUserId` INNER JOIN `postHistory` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`Id` = `T3`.`PostId` WHERE `T2`.`Views` >= 1000 AND `T3`.`PostId` IN (SELECT `PostId` FROM `postHistory` GROUP BY `PostId` HAVING COUNT(*) = 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly incorporating the condition for the count of post histories into the main query using a `JOIN` instead of a nested `SELECT`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
