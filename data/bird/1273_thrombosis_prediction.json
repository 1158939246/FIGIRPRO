Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients have a normal anti-SSB and are diagnosed with SLE in the examination?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who meet two criteria: they have a normal anti-SSB and they are diagnosed with SLE. The `Patient` table contains the diagnosis information, while the `Laboratory` table contains the anti-SSB results.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal anti-SSB> AND <diagnosed with SLE>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal anti-SSB  \n        * **Analysis:** The normal anti-SSB values are represented as 'negative' and '0' in the `Laboratory` table. We will filter based on the `SSB` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`SSB` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** diagnosed with SLE  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal anti-SSB):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`SSB` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (diagnosed with SLE):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`SSB` IN ('negative', '0') AND `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
