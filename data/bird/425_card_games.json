Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the card numbers that don't have multiple faces on a single card and have the subtypes Angel and Wizard?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter cards based on two conditions: they should not have multiple faces (indicated by `side` being NULL) and they should have both subtypes \"Angel\" and \"Wizard\". The `number` column in the `cards` table will be selected as the output.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `number` FROM `cards` WHERE <no multiple faces> AND <subtypes are Angel and Wizard>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** no multiple faces\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition where we check if the `side` column is NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `side` IS NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** subtypes are Angel and Wizard\n        * **Analysis:** We need to check if the `subtypes` column contains both \"Angel\" and \"Wizard\". Since `subtypes` is a text field, we can use the `LIKE` operator to check for both values.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `subtypes` LIKE '%Angel%' AND `subtypes` LIKE '%Wizard%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (no multiple faces):**\n    * **SQL:** `side` IS NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (subtypes are Angel and Wizard):**\n    * **SQL:** `subtypes` LIKE '%Angel%' AND `subtypes` LIKE '%Wizard%'\n\n* **Main Question (card numbers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `number` FROM `cards` WHERE `side` IS NULL AND `subtypes` LIKE '%Angel%' AND `subtypes` LIKE '%Wizard%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `cards` table based on the required conditions without any unnecessary joins or subqueries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
