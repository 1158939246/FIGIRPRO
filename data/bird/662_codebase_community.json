Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many posts with votes that were created in 2011 have a bounty of 50?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the posts that meet two criteria: they were created in 2011 and have a bounty amount of 50. The bounty amount is found in the `votes` table, while the creation date is in the `posts` table. We will need to join these two tables based on the `PostId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `votes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` WHERE <created in 2011> AND <bounty amount = 50>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** created in 2011  \n        * **Analysis:** This can be directly filtered using the `CreationDate` column in the `posts` table.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`CreationDate`) = 2011\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** bounty amount = 50  \n        * **Analysis:** This refers to the `BountyAmount` column in the `votes` table.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`BountyAmount` = 50\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (created in 2011):**  \n    * **SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`CreationDate`) = 2011\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (bounty amount = 50):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`BountyAmount` = 50\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `votes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` WHERE YEAR(`T1`.`CreationDate`) = 2011 AND `T2`.`BountyAmount` = 50\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `posts` and `votes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
