Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List and group all patients by sex for total bilirubin (T-BIL) level not within the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to group patients by their sex and list their IDs where the T-BIL level is not within the normal range (i.e., T-BIL >= 2.0). The `Patient` table contains the `SEX` column, and the `Laboratory` table contains the `T-BIL` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `SEX`, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT `ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <T-BIL not within normal range> GROUP BY `SEX`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** T-BIL not within normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `T-BIL` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (T-BIL not within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\n\n* **Main Question (grouping by sex):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `P`.`SEX`, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT `P`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0 GROUP BY `P`.`SEX`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by sex.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
