This requires a join between the `superhero` table and the `race` table to filter based on the race.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <race is Alien>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race is Alien\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `race` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Alien'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race is Alien):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Alien'\n\n* **Main Question (names of alien superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`race` = 'Alien'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `race` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
