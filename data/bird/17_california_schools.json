Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Rank schools by their average score in Writing where the score is greater than 499, showing their charter numbers.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the average score in Writing from the `satscores` table, filter for scores greater than 499, and include the `CharterNum` from the `schools` table. We will also need to rank the results based on the average score.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`CharterNum`, AVG(`T2`.`AvgScrWrite`) AS `AverageScore` FROM `satscores` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`cds` = `T1`.`CDSCode` WHERE <average score in Writing > 499 GROUP BY `T1`.`CharterNum` ORDER BY `AverageScore` DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** average score in Writing > 499\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `AvgScrWrite` column in the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`AvgScrWrite` > 499\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** valid charter number\n        * **Analysis:** We need to ensure that the `CharterNum` from the `schools` table is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`CharterNum` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average score in Writing > 499):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`AvgScrWrite` > 499\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (valid charter number):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`CharterNum` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (rank schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`CharterNum`, AVG(`T2`.`AvgScrWrite`) AS `AverageScore` FROM `satscores` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`cds` = `T1`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T2`.`AvgScrWrite` > 499 AND `T1`.`CharterNum` IS NOT NULL GROUP BY `T1`.`CharterNum` ORDER BY `AverageScore` DESC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause is necessary to aggregate the average scores by `CharterNum`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
