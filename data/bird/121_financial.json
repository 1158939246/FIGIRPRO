Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (district name is Prachatice):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`A2` = 'Prachatice'\n\n* **Main Question (account ID and opening date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id`, `T1`.`date` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`A2` = 'Prachatice'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
