Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many underage patients were examined during the course of the three-year period from 1990 to 1993?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who are underage (less than 18 years old) and were examined within the specified date range. This requires filtering based on the `Birthday` and `Examination Date` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <underage patients> AND <examination date between 1990 and 1993>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** underage patients\n        * **Analysis:** To determine if a patient is underage, we need to check if the year of their `Birthday` is less than 18 years before the current examination date. We can calculate the age by comparing the year of `Birthday` with the year of `Examination Date`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`) > STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Examination Date`) - 18\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** examination date between 1990 and 1993\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Examination` table based on the `Examination Date` column using the `BETWEEN` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Examination Date` BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1993-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (underage patients):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`) > STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Examination Date`) - 18\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (examination date between 1990 and 1993):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Examination Date` BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1993-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (count of underage patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`) > STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Examination Date`) - 18 AND `T1`.`Examination Date` BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1993-12-31'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Examination` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
