Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the client who applied 98832 USD loan in 1996/1/3, when was his/her birthday?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `birth_date` of the client who has a loan of 98832 USD approved on 1996/1/3. This involves joining the `loan` table with the `client` table based on the `account_id` and `client_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`birth_date` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T3`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `client` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` WHERE `T1`.`amount` = 98832 AND `T1`.`date` = '1996-01-03'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the loan with the specified amount and date.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `loan` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`amount` = 98832 AND `T1`.`date` = '1996-01-03'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (loan amount and date):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`amount` = 98832 AND `T1`.`date` = '1996-01-03'\n\n* **Main Question (client's birth date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`birth_date` FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T3`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `client` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` WHERE `T1`.`amount` = 98832 AND `T1`.`date` = '1996-01-03'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
