This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table to link superheroes to their powers, and then joining with the `superpower` table to filter by the specific power name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`id` = `T1`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <power_name = 'Death Touch'>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** power_name = 'Death Touch'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superpower` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`power_name` = 'Death Touch'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
