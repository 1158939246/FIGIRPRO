This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table to link the superhero to their powers, and then joining with the `superpower` table to get the actual power names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Deathlok'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (superpowers of Deathlok):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Deathlok'\n\n**3.
