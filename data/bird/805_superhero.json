Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (missing weight condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` IS NULL OR `T1`.`weight_kg` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (full names of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` IS NULL OR `T1`.`weight_kg` = 0\n\n**3.

It directly filters the `superhero` table based on the weight condition.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
