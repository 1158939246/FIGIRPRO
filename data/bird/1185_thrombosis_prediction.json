The decrease rate can be calculated as the difference between the two sums divided by the November sum.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(`T-CHO` WHERE <November 1981>) - SUM(`T-CHO` WHERE <December 1981>)) / SUM(`T-CHO` WHERE <November 1981>) AS decrease_rate FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Total cholesterol in November 1981\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Laboratory` table for records where the date is in November 1981 and the patient matches the specified birthday.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-11-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total cholesterol in December 1981\n        * **Analysis:** Similar to sub-question 1, but for December 1981.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-12-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Total cholesterol in November 1981):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-11-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Total cholesterol in December 1981):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-12-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18'\n\n* **Main Question (decrease rate calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-11-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18') - (SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-12-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18') / SUM(`T-CHO`) WHERE `Date` LIKE '1981-11-%' AND `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18' AS decrease_rate FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`Birthday` = '1959-02-18'\n\n**3.
