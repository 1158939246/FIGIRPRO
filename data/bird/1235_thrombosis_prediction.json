Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the patient's diagnosis for those who has lower red blood cell? State their ID and age.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `Diagnosis`, `ID`, and calculate the `age` for patients with an `RBC` value lower than 3.5. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis`, `T2`.`ID`, <age calculation> FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <RBC condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** RBC condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Laboratory` table for patients with an `RBC` value less than 3.5.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`RBC` < 3.5\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Age calculation\n        * **Analysis:** The age can be calculated using the `Birthday` column from the `Patient` table. We will use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the current timestamp and the `Birthday`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (RBC condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`RBC` < 3.5\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`)\n\n* **Main Question (patient's diagnosis, ID, and age):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis`, `T2`.`ID`, STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`) AS age FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`RBC` < 3.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applying the filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
