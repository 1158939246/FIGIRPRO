We need to filter this by the country, which is represented in the `Country` table. We will join the `League` and `Country` tables based on the `country_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `League` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Country` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`country_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Netherlands'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (name of the league):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `League` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Country` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`country_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Netherlands'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
