This requires filtering users based on their location and checking for the existence of both badges in the `badges` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`Id`) FROM `users` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`Location` = 'New York' AND <user has both badges>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** user has both badges  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to check if a user has both the \"Supporter\" and \"Teacher\" badges. This can be done by grouping the badges by `UserId` and filtering for those who have both badges.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Id` IN (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` WHERE `Name` IN ('Supporter', 'Teacher') GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT `Name`) = 2)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (user has both badges):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Id` IN (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` WHERE `Name` IN ('Supporter', 'Teacher') GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT `Name`) = 2)\n\n* **Main Question (count of users):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`Id`) FROM `users` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`Location` = 'New York' AND `T1`.`Id` IN (SELECT `UserId` FROM `badges` WHERE `Name` IN ('Supporter', 'Teacher') GROUP BY `UserId` HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT `Name`) = 2)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
