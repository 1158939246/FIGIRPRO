The `molecule` table contains the unique identifiers for each compound.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(<triple bond compounds>) * 100.0 / COUNT(<total compounds>)) AS percent FROM `molecule` AS `T1` WHERE <triple bond condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of compounds that form a triple bond\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `molecule` table with the `bond` table to filter for those compounds that have at least one bond of type '#'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`molecule_id`) FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T2`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total count of compounds\n        * **Analysis:** This is simply the count of distinct `molecule_id` in the `molecule` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`molecule_id`) FROM `molecule` AS `T1`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of compounds with triple bond):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`molecule_id`) FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T2`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total count of compounds):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`molecule_id`) FROM `molecule` AS `T1`\n\n* **Main Question (percentage of compounds with triple bond):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`molecule_id`) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`molecule_id`)) AS percent FROM `molecule` AS `T1` LEFT JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T2`.`bond_type` = '#'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a single `LEFT JOIN` to count both the total compounds and those with a triple bond in one go. We can use conditional aggregation to achieve this.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
