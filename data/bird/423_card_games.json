Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the ids of pairs where both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null. We will then sort these pairs by `cardKingdomFoilId` in alphabetical order and limit the results to the top three.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `cardKingdomFoilId`, `cardKingdomId` FROM `cards` WHERE <powerful pairs> ORDER BY `cardKingdomFoilId` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** powerful pairs\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter to ensure both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (powerful pairs):**\n    * **SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL`\n\n* **Main Question (top three powerful pairs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `cardKingdomFoilId`, `cardKingdomId` FROM `cards` WHERE `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL ORDER BY `cardKingdomFoilId` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `cards` table for non-null values and sorting the results as required.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
