Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the user with the highest bounty amount associated with vote type 8. This requires joining the `votes` table with the `users` table to get the display names and website URLs.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`DisplayName`, `T2`.`WebsiteUrl` FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <vote type is 8> AND <highest bounty amount>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** vote type is 8\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `votes` table using the `VoteTypeId` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`VoteTypeId` = 8\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest bounty amount\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum bounty amount from the `votes` table where the vote type is 8. This requires using the `MAX()` function after filtering.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`BountyAmount` = (SELECT MAX(`BountyAmount`) FROM `votes` WHERE `VoteTypeId` = 8)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (vote type is 8):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`VoteTypeId` = 8\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest bounty amount):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`BountyAmount` = (SELECT MAX(`BountyAmount`) FROM `votes` WHERE `VoteTypeId` = 8)\n\n* **Main Question (display names and website URLs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`DisplayName`, `T2`.`WebsiteUrl` FROM `votes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`VoteTypeId` = 8 AND `T1`.`BountyAmount` = (SELECT MAX(`BountyAmount`) FROM `votes` WHERE `VoteTypeId` = 8)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `votes` and `users` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
