We will need to join the `legalities` and `cards` tables based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `legalities` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <status is restricted> AND <cards have text boxes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** status is restricted\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `legalities` table using the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`status` = 'restricted'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** cards have text boxes\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `cards` table using the `isTextless` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`isTextless` = 0\n\n**2.
