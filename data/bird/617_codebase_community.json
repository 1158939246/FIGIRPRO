Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the detailed content of the comment of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `Text` from the `comments` table, but we first need to identify the `PostId` of the post created at the specified `CreationDate`. This requires joining the `posts` table to find the relevant post.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`PostId` = (SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the PostId of the post created on the specified date.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to filter the `posts` table by `CreationDate`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (PostId of the post):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'\n\n* **Main Question (detailed content of the comment):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`PostId` = (SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `posts` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`CreationDate` = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query is already efficient as it uses a subquery to find the `PostId` based on the `CreationDate`. There are no unnecessary joins or columns.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
