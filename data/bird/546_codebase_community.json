Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the display names of all the users who own a post that is well-finished.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `DisplayName` from the `users` table for users who own posts that have a non-null `ClosedDate`. This requires joining the `users` table with the `posts` table based on the `OwnerUserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`DisplayName` FROM `users` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`OwnerUserId` WHERE <post is well-finished>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** post is well-finished\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition that checks if the `ClosedDate` in the `posts` table is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (post is well-finished):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (display names of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`DisplayName` FROM `users` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`OwnerUserId` WHERE `T2`.`ClosedDate` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `users` and `posts` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
