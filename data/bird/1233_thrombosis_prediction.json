We will join the 'Patient' table with the 'Laboratory' table on the 'ID' field to correlate patient IDs with their respective glucose levels.

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List each patient's ID and blood glucose (GLU) index that were within normal range for patients whose data was first recorded in 1991.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` from the `Patient` table and the `GLU` from the `Laboratory` table. We will filter the patients based on the year of their first recorded data and the GLU index.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T2`.`GLU` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <GLU within normal range> AND <data recorded in 1991>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** GLU within normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `GLU` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GLU` < 180\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** data recorded in 1991\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Patient` table based on the `Description` column to check if the year is 1991.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Description`) = '1991'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (GLU within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GLU` < 180\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (data recorded in 1991):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Description`) = '1991'\n\n* **Main Question (patient ID and GLU index):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T2`.`GLU` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GLU` < 180 AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Description`) = '1991'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
