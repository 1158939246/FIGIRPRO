This information is contained in the `votes` table, specifically in the `BountyAmount` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `votes` WHERE <bounty amount over 30>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** bounty amount over 30\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `votes` table using the `BountyAmount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `BountyAmount` >= 30\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (bounty amount over 30):**\n    * **SQL:** `BountyAmount` >= 30\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `votes` WHERE `BountyAmount` >= 30\n\n**3.
