This requires joining the `income` table with the `member` table to filter by the member's name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`date_received` FROM `income` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <member name is Casey Mason>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** member name is Casey Mason\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `member` table to find the member with the first name \"Casey\" and last name \"Mason\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`first_name` = 'Casey' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'Mason'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
