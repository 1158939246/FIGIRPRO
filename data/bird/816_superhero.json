Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide the names of superheroes with attribute value between 75 to 80.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table, but we also need to filter based on the `attribute_value` from the `hero_attribute` table. This requires a join between the `superhero` and `hero_attribute` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_attribute` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` WHERE <attribute value between 75 and 80>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** attribute value between 75 and 80\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `hero_attribute` table using the `attribute_value` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`attribute_value` BETWEEN 75 AND 80\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (attribute value between 75 and 80):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`attribute_value` BETWEEN 75 AND 80\n\n* **Main Question (names of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_attribute` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` WHERE `T2`.`attribute_value` BETWEEN 75 AND 80\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
