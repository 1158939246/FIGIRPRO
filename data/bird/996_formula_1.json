Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (count of races per year):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(raceId) AS race_count, STRFTIME('%Y', date) AS race_year FROM races WHERE date BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2010-12-31' GROUP BY race_year\n\n* **Main Question (annual average number of races):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(race_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(raceId) AS race_count, STRFTIME('%Y', date) AS race_year FROM races WHERE date BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2010-12-31' GROUP BY race_year)\n\n**3.
