Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of members with t-shirt size of 'Medium'):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`member_id`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of members who received an amount of 50):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN `amount` = 50 THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN `I`.`amount` = 50 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(`M`.`member_id`)) AS percentage FROM `member` AS `M` INNER JOIN `income` AS `I` ON `M`.`member_id` = `I`.`link_to_member` WHERE `M`.`t_shirt_size` = 'Medium' AND `M`.`position` = 'Member'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `income` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
