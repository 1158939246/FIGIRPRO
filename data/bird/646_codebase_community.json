This requires joining the three tables based on their relationships.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Title`, `T2`.`DisplayName` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `comments` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`UserId` = `T3`.`Id` WHERE <positive comments>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** positive comments\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `comments` table using the `Score` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Score` > 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (positive comments):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Score` > 60\n\n* **Main Question (post title and user display names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Title`, `T3`.`DisplayName` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `comments` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`UserId` = `T3`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`Score` > 60\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
