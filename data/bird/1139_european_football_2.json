Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the final score for the match on September 24, 2008, in the Belgian Jupiler League between the home team and the away team?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `home_team_goal` and `away_team_goal` for the match that occurred on the specified date and in the specified league. This requires joining the `Match`, `League`, and possibly `Team` tables to filter by league name and date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `home_team_goal`, `away_team_goal` FROM `Match` AS `M` INNER JOIN `League` AS `L` ON `M`.`league_id` = `L`.`id` WHERE <match date> AND <league name>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** match date\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the matches based on the date provided in the question.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `M`.`date` LIKE '2008-09-24%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** league name\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the matches to only include those in the Belgian Jupiler League.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`name` = 'Belgium Jupiler League'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (match date):**\n    * **SQL:** `M`.`date` LIKE '2008-09-24%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (league name):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`name` = 'Belgium Jupiler League'\n\n* **Main Question (final score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `M`.`home_team_goal`, `M`.`away_team_goal` FROM `Match` AS `M` INNER JOIN `League` AS `L` ON `M`.`league_id` = `L`.`id` WHERE `M`.`date` LIKE '2008-09-24%' AND `L`.`name` = 'Belgium Jupiler League'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Match` and `League` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
