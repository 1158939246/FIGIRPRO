We need to filter the `cards` table based on two conditions: `borderColor` should be 'black' and `isFullArt` should be 1.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `uuid`, `name` FROM `cards` WHERE <black card borders> AND <has full artwork>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** black card borders\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `borderColor` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `borderColor` = 'black'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** has full artwork\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `isFullArt` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `isFullArt` = 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (black card borders):**\n    * **SQL:** `borderColor` = 'black'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (has full artwork):**\n    * **SQL:** `isFullArt` = 1\n\n* **Main Question (cards with black borders and full artwork):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `uuid`, `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `borderColor` = 'black' AND `isFullArt` = 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `cards` table based on the specified conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
