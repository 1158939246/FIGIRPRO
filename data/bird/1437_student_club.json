Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which members who were approved from 1/10/2019 to 11/19/2019?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find members who have expenses that were approved within the specified date range. The relevant tables are `member`, `attendance`, and `expense`. We will join these tables to get the required information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T3`.`link_to_event` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T3`.`link_to_event` WHERE <approved expenses> AND <date range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** approved expenses\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table where we select rows with `approved = 'true'`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`approved` = 'true'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date range\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `expense` table based on the `expense_date` column using the `BETWEEN` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`expense_date` BETWEEN '2019-01-10' AND '2019-11-19'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (approved expenses):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`approved` = 'true'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`expense_date` BETWEEN '2019-01-10' AND '2019-11-19'\n\n* **Main Question (members and event links):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`link_to_event` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_event` = `T3`.`link_to_event` WHERE `T3`.`approved` = 'true' AND `T3`.`expense_date` BETWEEN '2019-01-10' AND '2019-11-19'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
