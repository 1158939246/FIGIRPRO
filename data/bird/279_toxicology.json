We need to join the `bond` table with the `molecule` table to retrieve the `label` for the specified `bond_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`label` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`bond_id` = 'TR001_10_11'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (label for bond ID):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`label` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`bond_id` = 'TR001_10_11'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `bond` and `molecule` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly specifies the bond ID we are interested in.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
