This requires joining the `loan` and `account` tables based on `account_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <duration is 24 months> AND <frequency is weekly>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** duration is 24 months\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `loan` table using the `duration` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`duration` = 24\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** frequency is weekly\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `account` table using the `frequency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (duration is 24 months):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`duration` = 24\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (frequency is weekly):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n* **Main Question (count of loan accounts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `loan` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T1`.`duration` = 24 AND `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
