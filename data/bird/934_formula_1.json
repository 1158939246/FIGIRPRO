Please give his forename and surname.  \n**Evidence**: the no. 4 grid formation refers to grid = 4\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which driver was in the no. 4 grid formation when starting the race in 1989's Australian Grand Prix? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the driver's forename and surname based on the grid position and the specific race. The race can be identified by its name and year, and the grid position is specified as 4.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`forename`, `T3`.`surname` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T3`.`driverId` WHERE <grid position is 4> AND <race is 1989 Australian Grand Prix>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** grid position is 4\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `results` table using the `grid` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`grid` = 4\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race is 1989 Australian Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `races` table to find the specific race by its name and year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`year` = 1989 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (grid position is 4):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`grid` = 4\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race is 1989 Australian Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`year` = 1989 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n\n* **Main Question (driver's forename and surname):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`forename`, `T3`.`surname` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T3`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`grid` = 4 AND `T2`.`year` = 1989 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
