We will use the `cards` table for this.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <white bordered cards> AND <powerful cards>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** white bordered cards\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `borderColor` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `borderColor` = 'white'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** powerful cards\n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking that both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (white bordered cards):**\n    * **SQL:** `borderColor` = 'white'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (powerful cards):**\n    * **SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of powerful white bordered cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE `borderColor` = 'white' AND `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3.
