This requires joining the `expense` table with the `member` table to filter by the position.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`expense_description` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <position is Vice President>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** position is Vice President\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `member` table using the `position` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (position is Vice President):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n* **Main Question (list of expenses):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`expense_description` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE `T2`.`position` = 'Vice President'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
