Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the users who have more than 100 upvotes, how many of them have more than 1 downvotes?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count users based on two conditions: they must have more than 100 upvotes and more than 1 downvote. We will use the `users` table for this.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE <users with more than 100 upvotes> AND <users with more than 1 downvotes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** users with more than 100 upvotes\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `UpVotes` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `UpVotes > 100`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** users with more than 1 downvotes\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `DownVotes` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `DownVotes > 1`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (users with more than 100 upvotes):**\n    * **SQL:** `UpVotes > 100`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (users with more than 1 downvotes):**\n    * **SQL:** `DownVotes > 1`\n\n* **Main Question (count of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE `UpVotes` > 100 AND `DownVotes` > 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the users meeting both conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
