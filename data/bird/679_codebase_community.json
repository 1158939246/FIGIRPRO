Please give its id and title's name.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to find the post with the maximum score and return its id and title. We will need to join the `posts` table with the `users` table to get the owner's display name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Id`, `T1`.`Title` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <highest score>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest score\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the posts to find the one with the maximum score. This can be done using a subquery to get the maximum score from the `posts` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Score` = (SELECT MAX(`Score`) FROM `posts`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest score):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Score` = (SELECT MAX(`Score`) FROM `posts`)\n\n* **Main Question (id and title of the post with highest score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Id`, `T1`.`Title` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Score` = (SELECT MAX(`Score`) FROM `posts`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `posts` and `users` tables based on the relationship between `OwnerUserId` and `Id`. The subquery for the maximum score is straightforward and necessary for this query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
