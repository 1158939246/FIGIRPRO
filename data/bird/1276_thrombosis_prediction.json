This requires filtering the `Laboratory` table for the abnormal `DNA` levels and then joining it with the `Patient` table to get the corresponding `Diagnosis`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal level of anti-DNA>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal level of anti-DNA\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `DNA` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`DNA` >= 8\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal level of anti-DNA):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`DNA` >= 8\n\n* **Main Question (list of diseases):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`DNA` >= 8\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
