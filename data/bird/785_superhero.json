Examples of good alignments include Superman, Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man. Neutral: These superheroes may not always prioritize the greater good, but they are not necessarily evil either. They may act in their own self-interest or make decisions based on their own moral code. Examples of neutral alignments include the Hulk and Deadpool. \u0095\tBad: These superheroes are typically selfish, manipulative, and willing to harm others in pursuit of their own goals. Examples of evil alignments include Lex Luthor and the Joker."

We need to filter the `superhero` table based on the alignment criteria from the `alignment` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `alignment` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`alignment_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <alignment is neutral>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** alignment is neutral\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `alignment` table using the `alignment` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`alignment` = 'Neutral'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (alignment is neutral):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`alignment` = 'Neutral'\n\n* **Main Question (names of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `alignment` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`alignment_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`alignment` = 'Neutral'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `alignment` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
