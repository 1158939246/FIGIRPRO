Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patient who was diagnosed SLE on 1997/1/27, what was his/her original diagnose when he/she came to the hospital for the first time?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `Diagnosis` from the `Patient` table for the patient who has an `Examination Date` of '1997-01-27' and a diagnosis of 'SLE' in the `Examination` table. This requires joining the `Examination` and `Patient` tables based on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `P`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE <patient diagnosed SLE on 1997/1/27>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** patient diagnosed SLE on 1997/1/27\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Examination` table for the specific `Examination Date` and `Diagnosis`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE' AND `E`.`Examination Date` = '1997-01-27'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patient diagnosed SLE on 1997/1/27):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE' AND `E`.`Examination Date` = '1997-01-27'\n\n* **Main Question (original diagnosis):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `P`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE `E`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE' AND `E`.`Examination Date` = '1997-01-27'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
