Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the percentage of posts whose owners had a reputation of over 1000 in 2011?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate a percentage based on two counts: the count of posts created in 2011 by users with a reputation over 1000, and the total count of posts created in 2011. We will need to join the `posts` table with the `users` table to access the `Reputation` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE <condition for reputation and year>) / COUNT(T1.Id) * 100 FROM posts AS T1 INNER JOIN users AS T2 ON T1.OwnerUserId = T2.Id WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of posts where the owner's reputation is over 1000 in 2011\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `posts` table for those created in 2011 and joining with the `users` table to check the `Reputation`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011 AND T2.Reputation > 1000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total count of posts created in 2011\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward count of all posts created in 2011.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of posts with reputation over 1000 in 2011):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011 AND T2.Reputation > 1000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total count of posts in 2011):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011 AND T2.Reputation > 1000) * 100.0 / COUNT(T1.Id) WHERE YEAR(T1.CreationDate) = 2011 FROM posts AS T1 INNER JOIN users AS T2 ON T1.OwnerUserId = T2.Id\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a single `SELECT` statement with conditional aggregation to calculate both counts in one go.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
