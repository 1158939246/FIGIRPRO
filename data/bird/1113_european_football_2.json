Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the team \"Hannover 96\", what was its defence aggression class on 2015/9/10? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `defenceAggressionClass` from the `Team_Attributes` table for the team with the long name \"Hannover 96\" on the specified date. This requires joining the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables based on the `team_fifa_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`defenceAggressionClass` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_fifa_api_id` = `T2`.`team_fifa_api_id` WHERE <team is Hannover 96> AND <date is 2015/9/10>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** team is Hannover 96\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team` table using the `team_long_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Hannover 96'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date is 2015/9/10\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `Team_Attributes` table using the `date` column and the `LIKE` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date` LIKE '2015-09-10%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (team is Hannover 96):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Hannover 96'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date is 2015/9/10):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`date` LIKE '2015-09-10%'\n\n* **Main Question (defence aggression class):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`defenceAggressionClass` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_fifa_api_id` = `T2`.`team_fifa_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Hannover 96' AND `T2`.`date` LIKE '2015-09-10%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
