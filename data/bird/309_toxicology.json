This requires querying both the `atom` and `bond` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n      ```sql\n      SELECT `T1`.`atom_id`, COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`bond_type`) \n      FROM `atom` AS `T1` \n      LEFT JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` \n      WHERE `T1`.`molecule_id` = 'TR346' \n      GROUP BY `T1`.`atom_id`\n      ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Retrieve atom ids for TR346 molecule\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward selection from the `atom` table where the `molecule_id` is 'TR346'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346'`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count distinct bond types for TR346 molecule\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the distinct bond types from the `bond` table where the `molecule_id` is 'TR346'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bond_type) FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346'`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (atom ids for TR346):**\n    * **SQL:** `SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346'`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count distinct bond types for TR346):**\n    * **SQL:** `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bond_type) FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346'`\n\n* **Main Question (combine results):**\n    * **SQL:** \n      ```sql\n      SELECT `T1`.`atom_id`, COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`bond_type`) \n      FROM `atom` AS `T1` \n      LEFT JOIN `bond` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` \n      WHERE `T1`.`molecule_id` = 'TR346' \n      GROUP BY `T1`.`atom_id`\n      ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the `atom` and `bond` tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause allows us to count distinct bond types for each atom.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
