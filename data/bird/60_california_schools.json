Additionally, the 'Website' column in the 'schools' table provides the necessary information about the websites of these schools. The 'frpm' table is also relevant because it contains the 'Charter School Number' and 'CDSCode', which can help ensure that we are correctly identifying charter schools and linking them to their corresponding entries in the 'schools' table. However, since the 'schools' table already contains the necessary information about the charter status and websites, we can primarily rely on it for this query.
