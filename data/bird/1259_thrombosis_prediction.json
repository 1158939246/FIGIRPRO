We need to check for patients with RA values that indicate a normal condition (i.e., '-', '+-'). 3. The 'Examination' table is also necessary because it contains a Diagnosis column that may provide additional disease information related to the patients.

Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the diseases of the patients born after 1985-1-1 and have a normal Rhuematoid Factor.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `Diagnosis` from the `Patient` table where the `Birthday` is after January 1, 1985, and the `RA` value in the `Laboratory` table is either '-' or '+-'. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <born after 1985-1-1> AND <normal Rhuematoid Factor>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born after 1985-1-1\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Birthday` >= '1985-01-01'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal Rhuematoid Factor\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied to the `RA` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RA` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born after 1985-1-1):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Birthday` >= '1985-01-01'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal Rhuematoid Factor):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RA` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n* **Main Question (diseases of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Birthday` >= '1985-01-01' AND `T2`.`RA` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
