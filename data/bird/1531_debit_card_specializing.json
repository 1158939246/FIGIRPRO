Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Who is the top spending customer and how much is the average price per single item purchased by this customer? What currency was being used?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the customer who spent the most money, which involves summing the `Price` from the `transactions_1k` table grouped by `CustomerID`. We also need to calculate the average price per item for this customer, which is defined as `Total(price) / Total(amount)`. Additionally, we need to retrieve the currency used by this customer from the `customers` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT `CustomerID`, \n           SUM(`Price`) AS `TotalSpent`, \n           SUM(`Amount`) AS `TotalAmount`, \n           `Currency` \n    FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` \n    INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` \n    GROUP BY `CustomerID` \n    ORDER BY `TotalSpent` DESC \n    LIMIT 1\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Total spending per customer\n    * **Analysis:** This is calculated by summing the `Price` for each `CustomerID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `SUM(T1.Price)`\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Total amount of items purchased per customer\n    * **Analysis:** This is calculated by summing the `Amount` for each `CustomerID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `SUM(T1.Amount)`\n\n* **Sub-question 3:** Currency used by the customer\n    * **Analysis:** This is retrieved from the `customers` table based on the `CustomerID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2.Currency`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Total spending per customer):**\n    * **SQL:** `SUM(T1.Price)`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Total amount of items purchased per customer):**\n    * **SQL:** `SUM(T1.Amount)`\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (Currency used by the customer):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2.Currency`\n\n* **Main Question (top spending customer):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T1.CustomerID, \n           SUM(T1.Price) AS TotalSpent, \n           SUM(T1.Amount) AS TotalAmount, \n           T2.Currency \n    FROM transactions_1k AS T1 \n    INNER JOIN customers AS T2 ON T1.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID \n    GROUP BY T1.CustomerID \n    ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC \n    LIMIT 1\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `transactions_1k` and `customers` tables based on `CustomerID`, and we are grouping by `CustomerID` to calculate the total spending and total amount. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures we get the top spender.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
