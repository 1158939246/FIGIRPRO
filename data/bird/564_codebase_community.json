We also need to ensure that this post has exactly one comment, which can be checked using the `CommentCount` column in the `posts` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`ParentId` = 107829 AND `T2`.`CommentCount` = 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (comment text):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Text` FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T2`.`ParentId` = 107829 AND `T2`.`CommentCount` = 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `comments` and `posts` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
