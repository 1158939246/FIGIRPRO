This involves filtering the `account` table for the frequency and then checking the `loan` table for the loan amount.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `account` AS `A` INNER JOIN `loan` AS `L` ON `A`.`account_id` = `L`.`account_id` WHERE <weekly issuance> AND <loan amount under 200000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** weekly issuance\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `account` table using the `frequency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `A`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** loan amount under 200000\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `loan` table based on the `amount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`amount` < 200000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (weekly issuance):**\n    * **SQL:** `A`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (loan amount under 200000):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`amount` < 200000\n\n* **Main Question (count of accounts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `account` AS `A` INNER JOIN `loan` AS `L` ON `A`.`account_id` = `L`.`account_id` WHERE `A`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' AND `L`.`amount` < 200000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `account` and `loan` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
