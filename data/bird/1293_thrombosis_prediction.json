Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level of a patient with a normal creatinine level?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of the `ANA` column from the `Examination` table, but only for patients whose creatinine level (`CRE`) is less than 1.5. This requires joining the `Examination` table with the `Laboratory` table on the `ID` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`ANA`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal creatinine level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal creatinine level\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `CRE` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`CRE` < 1.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal creatinine level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`CRE` < 1.5\n\n* **Main Question (highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`ANA`) FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`CRE` < 1.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
