Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which of the play format has the highest number of banned status? Indicate the play format and the names of all the card meet the condition.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the play format with the maximum count of banned statuses and also retrieve the names of the cards that are banned in that format. This requires aggregating the counts of banned statuses by format and then joining with the cards to get their names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT <play format>, <card names> \n    FROM <legalities> AS T1 \n    INNER JOIN <cards> AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid \n    WHERE T1.status = 'Banned' \n    GROUP BY T1.format \n    HAVING COUNT(T1.status) = <max banned count>\n    ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of banned statuses by format\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of banned statuses for each format.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `COUNT(T1.status)`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Maximum count of banned statuses\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum count of banned statuses across all formats.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `MAX(COUNT(T1.status))`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Count of banned statuses by format):**\n    * **SQL:** `COUNT(T1.status)`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Maximum count of banned statuses):**\n    * **SQL:** `MAX(COUNT(T1.status))`\n\n* **Main Question (play format and card names):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T1.format, GROUP_CONCAT(T2.name) \n    FROM legalities AS T1 \n    INNER JOIN cards AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid \n    WHERE T1.status = 'Banned' \n    GROUP BY T1.format \n    HAVING COUNT(T1.status) = (SELECT MAX(banned_count) \n                                FROM (SELECT COUNT(status) AS banned_count \n                                      FROM legalities \n                                      WHERE status = 'Banned' \n                                      GROUP BY format))\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `legalities` and `cards` tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause effectively filters for the maximum count of banned statuses.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
