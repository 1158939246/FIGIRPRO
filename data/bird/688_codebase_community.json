Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Identify the number of posts that have been viewed over 35000 times but have received no comments from other users.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the posts that meet two conditions: they have a `ViewCount` greater than 35000 and a `CommentCount` equal to 0.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` WHERE <viewed over 35000 times> AND <received no comments>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** viewed over 35000 times\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `ViewCount` column in the `posts` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ViewCount` > 35000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** received no comments\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `CommentCount` column in the `posts` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `CommentCount` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (viewed over 35000 times):**\n    * **SQL:** `ViewCount` > 35000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (received no comments):**\n    * **SQL:** `CommentCount` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `posts` WHERE `ViewCount` > 35000 AND `CommentCount` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the posts that meet the specified conditions without unnecessary joins or subqueries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
