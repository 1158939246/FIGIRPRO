Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the patient's ID whose creatinine level is normal and whose anti Cardiolipin antibody concentration level is the highest.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter patients based on two criteria: their creatinine level (CRE) must be less than 1.5, and we need to find the maximum value of the anti Cardiolipin antibody concentration (aCL IgA). We will then select the patient ID corresponding to this maximum value.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` WHERE <creatinine level is normal> AND <anti Cardiolipin antibody concentration is the highest>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** creatinine level is normal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `CRE` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `CRE` < 1.5\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** anti Cardiolipin antibody concentration level is the highest\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of `aCL IgA` from the `Laboratory` table. This requires using the `MAX()` function after filtering for the normal creatinine levels.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `aCL IgA` = (SELECT MAX(`aCL IgA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `CRE` < 1.5)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (creatinine level is normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `CRE` < 1.5\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (anti Cardiolipin antibody concentration level is the highest):**\n    * **SQL:** `aCL IgA` = (SELECT MAX(`aCL IgA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `CRE` < 1.5)\n\n* **Main Question (patient's ID):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `CRE` < 1.5 AND `aCL IgA` = (SELECT MAX(`aCL IgA`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `CRE` < 1.5)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a single query with a `WHERE` clause that combines both conditions. We can also use a `GROUP BY` clause to ensure we are only selecting the maximum `aCL IgA` for patients with normal creatinine levels.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
