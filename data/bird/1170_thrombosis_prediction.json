Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients hadn't undergone a medical examination until at least a year following their initial hospital visit?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who meet the criteria of not having an examination date within one year of their first hospital visit. This involves joining the `Patient` and `Examination` tables and applying the necessary condition.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `P`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` LEFT JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE <condition for examination date and first date>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** condition for examination date and first date\n        * **Analysis:** We need to check if the difference in years between the `Examination Date` and `First Date` is greater than or equal to 1. This can be done using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from both dates.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `E`.`Examination Date`) - STRFTIME('%Y', `P`.`First Date`) >= 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (condition for examination date and first date):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `E`.`Examination Date`) - STRFTIME('%Y', `P`.`First Date`) >= 1\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `P`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` LEFT JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE (E.`Examination Date` IS NULL OR STRFTIME('%Y', `E`.`Examination Date`) - STRFTIME('%Y', `P`.`First Date`) >= 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we include patients who have no examination records, and we check for the condition in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
