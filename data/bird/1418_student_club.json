We need to filter these events based on their location, which is specified in the `event` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`category` FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <held at MU 215>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** held at MU 215\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `event` table using the `location` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`location` = 'MU 215'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (held at MU 215):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`location` = 'MU 215'\n\n* **Main Question (category of events):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`category` FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`location` = 'MU 215'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `budget` and `event` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
