This requires joining the `Match` table with the `League` table to filter by country.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`home_team_goal`) FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Poland' AND `T1`.`season` = '2010/2011'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter by country (Poland)\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `League` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Poland'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by season (2010/2011)\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Match` table using the `season` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`season` = '2010/2011'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
