This requires joining the `transactions_1k`, `customers`, and `gasstations` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T3`.`ChainID` FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T3`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** transactions in euro\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table using the `Currency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n**2.
