The 'expense' table is also crucial as it contains the 'expense_description', which is the kind of expense we are interested in. Additionally, the 'attendance' table is necessary to link members to events, but since the question does not directly ask about events, we can focus on the 'member' and 'expense' tables primarily. The 'budget' table is indirectly relevant as it connects expenses to budgets, but it is not directly needed for the specific question about expenses.
