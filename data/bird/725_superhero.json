We need to filter these superheroes based on the publisher, which is linked through the `publisher` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <published by Marvel Comics>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** published by Marvel Comics\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `publisher` table using the `publisher_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
