Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the rate of drivers completing all the laps in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the rate of drivers who completed all laps, which involves counting the number of drivers with a non-null `time` for the specific race and dividing it by the total number of drivers in that race.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`time` IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`)) AS `completion_rate` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T2`.`year` = 2008 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** COUNT of drivers completing all laps\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward count of `raceId` where `time` is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`time` IS NOT NULL)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** COUNT of total drivers in the race\n        * **Analysis:** This is a count of all `raceId` entries for the specific race.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (COUNT of drivers completing all laps):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`time` IS NOT NULL)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (COUNT of total drivers in the race):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`)\n\n* **Main Question (rate of completion):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`time` IS NOT NULL) * 1.0 / COUNT(`T1`.`raceId`)) AS `completion_rate` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T2`.`year` = 2008 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `results` and `races` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the specific race in 2008.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
