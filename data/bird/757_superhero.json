Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Identify the race of the superhero who weighed 169 kg.\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for the `race` of a superhero, which is stored in the `race` table. We need to find the superhero with a `weight_kg` of 169, which is stored in the `superhero` table. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `race` table based on the `race_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <weight is 169>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** weight is 169\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superhero` table using the `weight_kg` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` = 169\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (weight is 169):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` = 169\n\n* **Main Question (race of the superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` = 169\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
