Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the accounts who have loan validity more than 24 months, list out the accounts that have the lowest approved amount and have account opening date before 1997.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter accounts based on loan duration (greater than 24 months), account opening date (before 1997), and then find the account(s) with the lowest approved loan amount.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `account_id` FROM `account` WHERE <loan validity > 24 months> AND <account opening date < 1997> AND <lowest approved amount>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** loan validity > 24 months\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be checked in the `loan` table using the `duration` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `duration` > 24\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** account opening date < 1997\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be checked in the `account` table using the `date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `date` < '1997-01-01'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** lowest approved amount\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the minimum approved amount from the `loan` table, which can be done using the `amount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `amount` = (SELECT MIN(`amount`) FROM `loan` WHERE <conditions from sub-question 1>)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (loan validity > 24 months):**\n    * **SQL:** `duration` > 24\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (account opening date < 1997):**\n    * **SQL:** `date` < '1997-01-01'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (lowest approved amount):**\n    * **SQL:** `amount` = (SELECT MIN(`amount`) FROM `loan` WHERE `duration` > 24)\n\n* **Main Question (accounts with lowest approved amount):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `account_id` FROM `account` WHERE `date` < '1997-01-01' AND `account_id` IN (SELECT `account_id` FROM `loan` WHERE `duration` > 24 AND `amount` = (SELECT MIN(`amount`) FROM `loan` WHERE `duration` > 24))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* We can combine the conditions into a single query using `INNER JOIN` to link the `account` and `loan` tables based on `account_id`, filtering for the required conditions directly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
