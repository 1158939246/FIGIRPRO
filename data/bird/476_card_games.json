This requires joining the `cards` and `sets` tables based on the `setCode` and filtering by the set name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE <set is Coldsnap> ORDER BY <highest converted mana cost> LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** set is Coldsnap\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `sets` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest converted mana cost\n        * **Analysis:** We need to order the results by `convertedManaCost` in descending order to get the highest value.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`convertedManaCost` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (set is Coldsnap):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest converted mana cost):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`convertedManaCost` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (name of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Coldsnap' ORDER BY `T1`.`convertedManaCost` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures we get the card with the highest converted mana cost.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
