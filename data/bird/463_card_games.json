The translations are stored in the `set_translations` table, and we need to find the relevant cards in the `cards` table first.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `set_translations` WHERE <translations for cards with name 'Angel of Mercy'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** translations for cards with name 'Angel of Mercy'\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `set_translations` table with the `cards` table to filter translations based on the card name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `uuid` IN (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Angel of Mercy')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (translations for cards with name 'Angel of Mercy'):**\n    * **SQL:** `uuid` IN (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Angel of Mercy')\n\n* **Main Question (count of translations):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `set_translations` WHERE `uuid` IN (SELECT `uuid` FROM `cards` WHERE `name` = 'Angel of Mercy')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
