Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How much is the average build up play speed of the Heart of Midlothian team? \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for the average of the `buildUpPlaySpeed` for the team identified by `team_long_name = 'Heart of Midlothian'`. We will need to join the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables to access the `buildUpPlaySpeed` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeed`) FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_fifa_api_id` = `T2`.`team_fifa_api_id` WHERE <team is Heart of Midlothian>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** team is Heart of Midlothian\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team` table using the `team_long_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Heart of Midlothian'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (team is Heart of Midlothian):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Heart of Midlothian'\n\n* **Main Question (average build up play speed):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeed`) FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_fifa_api_id` = `T2`.`team_fifa_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Heart of Midlothian'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applied the filter directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
