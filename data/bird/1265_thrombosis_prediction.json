Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients have a normal level of anti-ribonuclear protein and have been admitted to the hospital?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who meet two criteria: they have a normal level of anti-ribonuclear protein (RNP) and they have been admitted to the hospital (Admission = '+').  \n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `ID`) FROM `Patient` WHERE <normal level of anti-ribonuclear protein> AND <admitted to the hospital>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal level of anti-ribonuclear protein  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `RNP` column in the `Examination` table for values that indicate a normal level. We will join the `Patient` and `Examination` tables on `ID`.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `RNP` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** admitted to the hospital  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Admission` = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal level of anti-ribonuclear protein):**  \n    * **SQL:** `RNP` IN ('-', '+-')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (admitted to the hospital):**  \n    * **SQL:** `Admission` = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `P`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE `E`.`RNP` IN ('-', '+-') AND `P`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
