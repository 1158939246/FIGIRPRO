Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all the female patients aged 50 and above, who have an abnormal red blood cell count. State if they were admitted to the hospital.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Patient` table for female patients aged 50 and above, and then join with the `Laboratory` table to check for abnormal red blood cell counts. Finally, we will select the admission status.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Admission`, `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <female patients> AND <age 50 and above> AND <abnormal RBC count>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Sex` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Sex` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age 50 and above\n        * **Analysis:** We will calculate the age using the `Birthday` column and compare it to 50 years. We can use the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year from the current timestamp.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(`T1`.`Birthday`)) >= 50\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** abnormal red blood cell count\n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking the `RBC` column in the `Laboratory` table for values that are either less than or equal to 3.5 or greater than or equal to 6.0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`RBC` >= 6.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Sex` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age 50 and above):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) >= 50\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (abnormal RBC count):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`RBC` >= 6.0\n\n* **Main Question (admission status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Admission`, `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Sex` = 'F' AND STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`Birthday`) >= 50 AND (`T2`.`RBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`RBC` >= 6.0)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
