Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the superhero names of all the superheroes that have blue eyes and blond hair.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter superheroes based on their eye color and hair color, and then select their names. This requires joining the `superhero`, `colour`, and `hero_power` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE <blue eyes> AND <blond hair>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** blue eyes\n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking the `eye_colour_id` in the `superhero` table against the `colour` table for the color 'Blue'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `colour` WHERE `colour` = 'Blue')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** blond hair\n        * **Analysis:** Similar to the blue eyes condition, we need to check the `hair_colour_id` in the `superhero` table against the `colour` table for the color 'Blond'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `colour` WHERE `colour` = 'Blond')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (blue eyes):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `colour` WHERE `colour` = 'Blue')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (blond hair):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `colour` WHERE `colour` = 'Blond')\n\n* **Main Question (superhero names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `colour` WHERE `colour` = 'Blue') AND `T1`.`hair_colour_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `colour` WHERE `colour` = 'Blond')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses `INNER JOIN` logic through subqueries to filter the superheroes based on their eye and hair colors.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
