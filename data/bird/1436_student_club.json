This involves joining the `attendance`, `member`, and `expense` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`link_to_event` FROM `attendance` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`member_id` = `T3`.`link_to_member` WHERE <cost > 50>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** cost > 50\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `cost` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`cost` > 50\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
