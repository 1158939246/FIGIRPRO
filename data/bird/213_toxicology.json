This requires checking the `connected` table to see if there is a bond between these two atoms.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`bond_type` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`bond_id` = `T2`.`bond_id` WHERE (<condition for TR004_8 and TR004_20>)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** condition for TR004_8 and TR004_20\n        * **Analysis:** We need to check if either `atom_id` is 'TR004_8' and `atom_id2` is 'TR004_20', or vice versa.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`atom_id` = 'TR004_8' AND `T2`.`atom_id2` = 'TR004_20' OR `T2`.`atom_id` = 'TR004_20' AND `T2`.`atom_id2` = 'TR004_8'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `bond` and `connected` tables based on their relationship. The `WHERE` clause clearly defines the conditions for the atoms.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
