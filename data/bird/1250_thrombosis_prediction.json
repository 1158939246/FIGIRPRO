Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which patient has a normal proteinuria level and is diagnosed with SLE? Please give his or her patient ID.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the patient ID from the `Patient` table where the patient has a normal proteinuria level and is diagnosed with SLE. The normal proteinuria level is defined by the `U-PRO` column in the `Laboratory` table, and the diagnosis is in the `Diagnosis` column of the `Patient` table.

Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal proteinuria level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`U-PRO` > 0 AND `T2`.`U-PRO` < 30\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (diagnosed with SLE):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n* **Main Question (patient ID):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`U-PRO` > 0 AND `T2`.`U-PRO` < 30 AND `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'SLE'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
