                "plan": "**Question**: In which years did Lewis Hamilton participate in a Formula_1 race?  \n**Evidence**: \n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In which years did Lewis Hamilton participate in a Formula_1 race?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the years in which Lewis Hamilton participated in races. This requires us to identify Lewis Hamilton's `driverId` from the `drivers` table and then find the corresponding `year` from the `races` table through the `results` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `year` FROM `races` WHERE <Lewis Hamilton's races>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Lewis Hamilton's races\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `results` table with the `drivers` table to filter results for Lewis Hamilton using his `driverId`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Lewis Hamilton's races):**\n    * **SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton')\n\n* **Main Question (years of participation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `year` FROM `races` WHERE `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T2`.`surname` = 'Hamilton')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `races`, `results`, and `drivers` tables in a single query without using a nested subquery.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
