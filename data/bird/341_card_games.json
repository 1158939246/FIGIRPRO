Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the borderless cards available without powerful foils?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter cards based on two criteria: they must be borderless (indicated by the `borderColor` column) and they must not have powerful foils (indicated by the presence of `cardKingdomFoilId` paired with a non-null `cardKingdomId`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE <borderless condition> AND <no powerful foils condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** borderless condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `borderColor` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `borderColor` = 'borderless'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** no powerful foils condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to ensure that `cardKingdomFoilId` is null or that `cardKingdomId` is null. This means we want to exclude cards that have a `cardKingdomFoilId` paired with a non-null `cardKingdomId`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NULL OR `cardKingdomId` IS NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (borderless condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `borderColor` = 'borderless'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (no powerful foils condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NULL OR `cardKingdomId` IS NULL\n\n* **Main Question (borderless cards without powerful foils):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `borderColor` = 'borderless' AND (`cardKingdomFoilId` IS NULL OR `cardKingdomId` IS NULL)\n\n**3.
