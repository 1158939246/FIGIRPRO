Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all the transactions happened during 8:00-9:00 in 2012/8/26, how many happened in CZE?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the transactions that occurred during a specific time frame on a specific date and are associated with gas stations located in the Czech Republic. This requires filtering based on the `Time`, `Date`, and `Country`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`TransactionID`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE <transactions during 8:00-9:00> AND <transactions on 2012-08-26> AND <country is CZE>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** transactions during 8:00-9:00\n        * **Analysis:** This can be filtered directly using the `Time` column in the `transactions_1k` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Time` BETWEEN '08:00:00' AND '09:00:00'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** transactions on 2012-08-26\n        * **Analysis:** This can be filtered using the `Date` column in the `transactions_1k` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-26'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** country is CZE\n        * **Analysis:** This can be filtered using the `Country` column in the `gasstations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (transactions during 8:00-9:00):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Time` BETWEEN '08:00:00' AND '09:00:00'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (transactions on 2012-08-26):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-26'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (country is CZE):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n* **Main Question (count of transactions):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`TransactionID`) FROM `transactions_1k` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gasstations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`GasStationID` = `T2`.`GasStationID` WHERE `T1`.`Time` BETWEEN '08:00:00' AND '09:00:00' AND `T1`.`Date` = '2012-08-26' AND `T2`.`Country` = 'CZE'\n\n**3.

We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
