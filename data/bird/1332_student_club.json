We need to filter the `budget` table for the category 'Food' and link it to the `event` table to ensure it corresponds to the 'September Meeting'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`spent`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <category is Food> AND <event name is September Meeting>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** category is Food  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `budget` table using the `category` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`category` = 'Food'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** event name is September Meeting  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `event` table using the `event_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'September Meeting'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (category is Food):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`category` = 'Food'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (event name is September Meeting):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'September Meeting'\n\n* **Main Question (total spent on food for September Meeting):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`T1`.`spent`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T1`.`category` = 'Food' AND `T2`.`event_name` = 'September Meeting'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `budget` and `event` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
