This involves filtering the `disp` table for the type 'OWNER' and joining it with the `account` table to filter by frequency.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`client_id`) FROM `disp` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <frequency is weekly issuance> AND <type is Owner>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** frequency is weekly issuance\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `account` table using the `frequency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** type is Owner\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `disp` table using the `type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (frequency is weekly issuance):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (type is Owner):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n* **Main Question (count of clients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`client_id`) FROM `disp` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE `T2`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' AND `T1`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
