The `customers` table contains the currency information, while the `yearmonth` table contains the consumption data. We will need to join these two tables based on `CustomerID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`CustomerID`) FROM `customers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `yearmonth` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE <currency is EUR> AND <monthly consumption is over 1000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** currency is EUR\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** monthly consumption is over 1000\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `yearmonth` table using the `Consumption` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Consumption` > 1000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (currency is EUR):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (monthly consumption is over 1000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Consumption` > 1000\n\n* **Main Question (count of customers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`CustomerID`) FROM `customers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `yearmonth` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T1`.`Currency` = 'EUR' AND `T2`.`Consumption` > 1000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
