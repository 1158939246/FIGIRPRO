This requires joining the `disp` and `card` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `disp` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `card` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`disp_id` = `T2`.`disp_id` WHERE <junior credit card> AND <issued after 1996>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** junior credit card\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `type` column of the `card` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`type` = 'junior'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** issued after 1996\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `issued` column in the `card` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`issued` >= '1997-01-01'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (junior credit card):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`type` = 'junior'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (issued after 1996):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`issued` >= '1997-01-01'\n\n* **Main Question (clients' IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `disp` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `card` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`disp_id` = `T2`.`disp_id` WHERE `T2`.`type` = 'junior' AND `T2`.`issued` >= '1997-01-01'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
