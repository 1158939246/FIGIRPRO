Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among all events held by the Student_Club in 2019, find the percentage share of events related to 'Community Service'.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of events that are of type 'Community Service' out of all events in 2019.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with conditional aggregation to calculate the percentage share of 'Community Service' events among all events in 2019.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
