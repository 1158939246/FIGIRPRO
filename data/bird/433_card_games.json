Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the percentage of the set of cards that have Chinese Simplified as the language and are only available for online games?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of cards that meet two criteria: they must have the language 'Chinese Simplified' and be marked as only available for online games. This requires counting the total number of cards and the number of cards that meet both conditions.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN `isOnlineOnly` = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage FROM `cards` WHERE <language is Chinese Simplified>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** language is Chinese Simplified\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `language` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (language is Chinese Simplified):**\n    * **SQL:** `language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN `isOnlineOnly` = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage FROM `cards` WHERE `language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a single `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the cards based on the language and calculating the percentage directly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
