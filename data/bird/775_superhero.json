We will use the `SUM` and `COUNT` functions to achieve this.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(<blue female superheroes>) / COUNT(<all female superheroes>)) * 100 AS percentage FROM <superhero table> WHERE <gender is female>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of blue female superheroes  \n        * **Analysis:** To find blue female superheroes, we need to join the `superhero`, `gender`, and `colour` tables. We will filter for female gender and blue color.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `colour`.`colour` = 'Blue' AND `gender`.`gender` = 'Female' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of all female superheroes  \n        * **Analysis:** This requires counting all superheroes that are female.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN `gender`.`gender` = 'Female' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applies the required filters directly in the `SELECT` statement.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
