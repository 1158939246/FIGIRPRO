We need to filter the translations based on the set name \"Tenth Edition\" from the `sets` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`translation`) FROM `set_translations` AS `T1` WHERE <set name is Tenth Edition> AND <translation is not NULL>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** set name is Tenth Edition  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `set_translations` table with the `sets` table to filter by the set name \"Tenth Edition\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`setCode` IN (SELECT `T2`.`code` FROM `sets` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Tenth Edition')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** translation is not NULL  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `set_translations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (set name is Tenth Edition):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`setCode` IN (SELECT `T2`.`code` FROM `sets` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Tenth Edition')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (translation is not NULL):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of translations):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`translation`) FROM `set_translations` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`setCode` IN (SELECT `T2`.`code` FROM `sets` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Tenth Edition') AND `T1`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
