Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For in-patient age 50 and above, what is their average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of the `aCL IgG` concentration for patients who are in-patients (Admission = '+') and are 50 years or older. This requires filtering based on the `Admission` column and calculating the age from the `Birthday` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`aCL IgG`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <in-patient> AND <age 50 and above>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** in-patient\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age 50 and above\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the age based on the `Birthday` column. The condition will check if the difference between the current year and the year of birth is 50 or more.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUBTRACT(YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), YEAR(`T1`.`Birthday`)) >= 50\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (in-patient):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '+'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age 50 and above):**\n    * **SQL:** SUBTRACT(YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), YEAR(`T1`.`Birthday`)) >= 50\n\n* **Main Question (average anti-cardiolipin antibody concentration):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`aCL IgG`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Admission` = '+' AND SUBTRACT(YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), YEAR(`T1`.`Birthday`)) >= 50\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
