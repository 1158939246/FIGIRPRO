Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many football players born after the 1990s have the first name \"Aaron\"? \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of players, which can be obtained using `COUNT()`. We need to filter the players based on two criteria: their first name starts with \"Aaron\" and their birthday is after 1990.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` WHERE <first name is Aaron> AND <born after 1990>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** first name is Aaron\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `player_name` LIKE 'Aaron%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** born after 1990\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `birthday` column directly.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `birthday` > '1990-01-01'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (first name is Aaron):**\n    * **SQL:** `player_name` LIKE 'Aaron%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (born after 1990):**\n    * **SQL:** `birthday` > '1990-01-01'\n\n* **Main Question (count of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` WHERE `player_name` LIKE 'Aaron%' AND `birthday` > '1990-01-01'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of players meeting both conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
