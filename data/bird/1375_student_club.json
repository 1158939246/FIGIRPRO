Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all the members of the \"School of Applied Sciences, Technology and Education\" department.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the full names of members from the `member` table who belong to the specified department. The full name is constructed from the `first_name` and `last_name` columns. To filter members by department, we need to join the `member` table with the `major` table using the `link_to_major` foreign key.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`department` = 'School of Applied Sciences, Technology and Education'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (full names of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE `T2`.`department` = 'School of Applied Sciences, Technology and Education'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
