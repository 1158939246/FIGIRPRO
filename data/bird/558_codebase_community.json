Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many votes did the user No.58 take on 2010/7/19?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of votes made by a specific user on a specific date. We will use the `votes` table to get this information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `votes` WHERE <user is No.58> AND <date is 2010/7/19>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** user is No.58  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `UserId` column in the `votes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `UserId` = 58\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date is 2010/7/19  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `votes` table based on the `CreationDate` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `CreationDate` = '2010-07-19'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (user is No.58):**  \n    * **SQL:** `UserId` = 58\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date is 2010/7/19):**  \n    * **SQL:** `CreationDate` = '2010-07-19'\n\n* **Main Question (count of votes):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `votes` WHERE `UserId` = 58 AND `CreationDate` = '2010-07-19'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the votes for the specified user on the specified date without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
