To do this, we first need to identify Lewis Hamilton's `driverId` from the `drivers` table. Then, we will sum the points from the `results` table where the `driverId` matches.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`points`) FROM `results` WHERE `driverId` = <Lewis Hamilton's driverId>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify Lewis Hamilton's driverId\n        * **Analysis:** We will query the `drivers` table to find the `driverId` for Lewis Hamilton.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `forename` = 'Lewis' AND `surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Lewis Hamilton's driverId):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `forename` = 'Lewis' AND `surname` = 'Hamilton'\n\n* **Main Question (total points):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`points`) FROM `results` WHERE `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `drivers` WHERE `forename` = 'Lewis' AND `surname` = 'Hamilton')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the `driverId` for Lewis Hamilton and then summing the points from the `results` table based on that `driverId`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
