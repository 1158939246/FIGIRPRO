State his/her full name along with the income source.  \n**Evidence**: name of students means the full name; full name refers to first_name, last_name; generate the highest income refers to MAX(income.amount);\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which students manage to generate the highest income? State his/her full name along with the income source.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the full name of the student and the income source for the maximum income. The full name is derived from the `first_name` and `last_name` columns in the `member` table, and the income source is from the `source` column in the `income` table. We will need to join these two tables based on the `link_to_member` foreign key.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`source` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE <highest income>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** highest income\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum income amount from the `income` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `income`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (highest income):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `income`)\n\n* **Main Question (full name and income source):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name`, `T2`.`source` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE `T2`.`amount` = (SELECT MAX(`amount`) FROM `income`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `income` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the maximum income.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
