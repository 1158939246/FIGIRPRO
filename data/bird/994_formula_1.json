Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which constructor scored most points from Monaco Grand Prix between 1980 and 2010? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the constructor with the highest total points from the Monaco Grand Prix within the specified years. This involves joining the `constructorResults`, `races`, and `constructors` tables to get the necessary information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, `T2`.`nationality`, SUM(`T1`.`points`) AS `total_points` FROM `constructorResults` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `constructors` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`constructorId` = `T3`.`constructorId` WHERE <Monaco Grand Prix> AND <year between 1980 and 2010> GROUP BY `T2`.`constructorId` ORDER BY `total_points` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Monaco Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the races to only include the Monaco Grand Prix.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Monaco Grand Prix'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** year between 1980 and 2010\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the races based on the `year` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 2010\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Monaco Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Monaco Grand Prix'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (year between 1980 and 2010):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 2010\n\n* **Main Question (highest scoring constructor):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`nationality`, SUM(`T1`.`points`) AS `total_points` FROM `constructorResults` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `constructors` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`constructorId` = `T3`.`constructorId` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Monaco Grand Prix' AND `T2`.`year` BETWEEN 1980 AND 2010 GROUP BY `T3`.`constructorId` ORDER BY `total_points` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filtering based on the race name and year range. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate points by constructor, and we are ordering by total points to find the highest.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
