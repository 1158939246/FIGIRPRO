This involves two steps: first, identifying the district with the maximum number of crimes, and then counting the accounts associated with that district.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`account_id`) FROM `account` WHERE `district_id` = <district with max crimes in 1996>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** district with max crimes in 1996\n        * **Analysis:** We will select the `district_id` from the `district` table where the number of crimes (A16) is maximized.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A16` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (district with max crimes in 1996):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A16` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Main Question (count of accounts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`account_id`) FROM `account` WHERE `district_id` = (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A16` DESC LIMIT 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the district with the maximum number of crimes and then counting the accounts in that district.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
