Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list top two sets of cards with their IDs that have Italian-language cards and are located in the Shadowmoor block in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the set names and IDs from the `sets` table, filtering for those that are in the Shadowmoor block and have associated Italian-language cards. This requires joining the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table to filter by language.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id`, `T1`.`name` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <Italian-language cards> AND <located in Shadowmoor block> ORDER BY `T1`.`name` ASC LIMIT 2\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Italian-language cards\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `set_translations` table where the `language` column matches 'Italian'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** located in Shadowmoor block\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `sets` table where the `block` column matches 'Shadowmoor'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`block` = 'Shadowmoor'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Italian-language cards):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (located in Shadowmoor block):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`block` = 'Shadowmoor'\n\n* **Main Question (top two sets):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id`, `T1`.`name` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T1`.`block` = 'Shadowmoor' ORDER BY `T1`.`name` ASC LIMIT 2\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables and applying the necessary filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
