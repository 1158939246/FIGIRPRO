Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the players whose height is over 180, how many of them have a volley score of over 70?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count players based on two conditions: their height must be greater than 180, and their volley score must be greater than 70. Both conditions can be applied directly to the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_api_id` = `PA`.`player_api_id` WHERE <height condition> AND <volley score condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** height condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters players based on their height.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`height` > 180\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** volley score condition\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters players based on their volley score.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `PA`.`volleys` > 70\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (height condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`height` > 180\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (volley score condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `PA`.`volleys` > 70\n\n* **Main Question (count of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA` ON `P`.`player_api_id` = `PA`.`player_api_id` WHERE `P`.`height` > 180 AND `PA`.`volleys` > 70\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
