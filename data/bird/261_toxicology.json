This requires joining the `bond` table with the `molecule` table based on the `molecule_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`bond_id` FROM `bond` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <molecule is carcinogenic>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** molecule is carcinogenic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `molecule` table using the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`label` = '+'\n\n**2.
