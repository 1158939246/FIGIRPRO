'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' stands for issuance after transaction.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For accounts in 1993 with statement issued after transaction, list the account ID, district name and district region.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `account_id`, `district name`, and `district region` for accounts that were active in 1993 and have a specific frequency indicating a statement issued after a transaction. This requires joining the `account`, `district`, and filtering based on the year of the `date` in the `account` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id`, `T2`.`A2`, `T2`.`A3` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <accounts in 1993> AND <statement issued after transaction>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** accounts in 1993\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `account` table for records where the `date` is in the year 1993. This can be done using the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year from the `date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '1993'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** statement issued after transaction\n        * **Analysis:** This refers to filtering the `account` table based on the `frequency` column, specifically looking for the value 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (accounts in 1993):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '1993'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (statement issued after transaction):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n\n* **Main Question (account ID, district name, and district region):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id`, `T2`.`A2`, `T2`.`A3` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`date`) = '1993' AND `T1`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `account` and `district` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
