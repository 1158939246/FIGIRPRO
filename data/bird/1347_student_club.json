This requires us to join the `member` table with the `zip_code` table to access the county information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `county` FROM `zip_code` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip_code` = `T2`.`zip` WHERE `T2`.`first_name` = 'Adela' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'O''Gallagher'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the member with the name \"Adela O'Gallagher\".\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `member` table using the `first_name` and `last_name` columns.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`first_name` = 'Adela' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'O''Gallagher'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (member identification):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`first_name` = 'Adela' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'O''Gallagher'\n\n* **Main Question (hometown county):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`county` FROM `zip_code` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip_code` = `T2`.`zip` WHERE `T2`.`first_name` = 'Adela' AND `T2`.`last_name` = 'O''Gallagher'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `zip_code` tables based on the relationship between the member's zip code and the zip code table. The filtering criteria are clearly defined.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
