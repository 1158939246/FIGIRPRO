Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the overall rating for Aaron Mooy on 2016/2/4?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `overall_rating` for the player named Aaron Mooy on the specified date. This requires joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the `player_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`overall_rating` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <Aaron Mooy> AND <on 2016/2/4>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Aaron Mooy  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`player_name` = 'Aaron Mooy'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** on 2016/2/4  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `Player_Attributes` table using the `date` column and the `LIKE` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date` LIKE '2016-02-04%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Aaron Mooy):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`player_name` = 'Aaron Mooy'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (on 2016/2/4):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`date` LIKE '2016-02-04%'\n\n* **Main Question (overall rating):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`overall_rating` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`player_name` = 'Aaron Mooy' AND `T2`.`date` LIKE '2016-02-04%'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
