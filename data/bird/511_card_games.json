Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the most common visual frame effects among the incredibly powerful foils?\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the most common visual frame effects, which can be derived from the `frameEffects` column in the `cards` table. We need to filter the data to include only those cards that are considered \"incredibly powerful foils,\" which is defined by the condition that both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`frameEffects`) FROM `cards` WHERE <incredibly powerful foils>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** incredibly powerful foils\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `cards` table by checking that both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (incredibly powerful foils):**\n    * **SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL`\n\n* **Main Question (most common visual frame effects):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`frameEffects`) FROM `cards` WHERE `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `cards` table based on the conditions provided and selecting the maximum `frameEffects`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
