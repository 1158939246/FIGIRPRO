Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which non-carcinogenic molecules consisted of more than 5 atoms?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter for non-carcinogenic molecules (where `label` is '-') and count the number of atoms associated with each molecule. We will then filter those counts to find molecules with more than 5 atoms.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `molecule_id` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <non-carcinogenic> GROUP BY `molecule_id` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) > 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** non-carcinogenic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `molecule` table using the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`label` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (non-carcinogenic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`label` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (molecules with more than 5 atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`molecule_id` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T1`.`label` = '-' GROUP BY `T1`.`molecule_id` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) > 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `molecule` and `atom` tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause correctly filters for molecules with more than 5 atoms.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
