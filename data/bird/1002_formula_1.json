Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (youngest racer):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`dob` = (SELECT MAX(`dob`) FROM `drivers`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (first race):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` WHERE `driverId` = `T1`.`driverId` ORDER BY `raceId` ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n* **Main Question (full name, nationality, and first race):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename` || ' ' || `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`nationality`, `T3`.`name` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `results` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`dob` = (SELECT MAX(`dob`) FROM `drivers`) AND `T2`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `results` WHERE `driverId` = `T1`.`driverId` ORDER BY `raceId` ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n**3.
