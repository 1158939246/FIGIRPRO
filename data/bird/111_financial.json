This requires filtering the `account` table based on the district name and the date of account opening.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`account_id`) FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <district is Litomerice> AND <account opened in 1996>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** district is Litomerice\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `district` table using the `A2` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A2` = 'Litomerice'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** account opened in 1996\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `account` table based on the `date` column.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
