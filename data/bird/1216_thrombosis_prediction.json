Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Sort in descending order all patients by birthday for male patients with albumin not within range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select patients from the `Patient` table and join it with the `Laboratory` table to filter based on the `SEX` and `ALB` conditions. The final output should be sorted by `Birthday` in descending order.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <albumin not within range> ORDER BY `T1`.`Birthday` DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** albumin not within range\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks the `ALB` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it is either less than or equal to 3.5 or greater than or equal to 5.5.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ALB` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`ALB` >= 5.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (albumin not within range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ALB` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`ALB` >= 5.5\n\n* **Main Question (sorting patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`SEX` = 'M' AND (`T2`.`ALB` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`ALB` >= 5.5) ORDER BY `T1`.`Birthday` DESC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause is correctly applied to sort the results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
