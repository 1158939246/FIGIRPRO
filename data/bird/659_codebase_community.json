Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many tags have post count between 5,000 to 7,000?\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of tags, specifically those with a `Count` value between 5,000 and 7,000. We will use the `Count` column from the `tags` table to filter and count the relevant entries.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `tags` WHERE <post count between 5000 and 7000>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** post count between 5000 and 7000\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Count` column in the `tags` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Count` BETWEEN 5000 AND 7000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (post count between 5000 and 7000):**\n    * **SQL:** `Count` BETWEEN 5000 AND 7000\n\n* **Main Question (count of tags):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `tags` WHERE `Count` BETWEEN 5000 AND 7000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient and straightforward. It directly counts the number of tags that meet the specified condition.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
