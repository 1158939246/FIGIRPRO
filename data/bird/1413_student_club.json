This requires joining the `member` and `expense` tables based on the member's ID and filtering by the cost of the expense.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`zip` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE <cost < 50>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** cost < 50\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `expense` table where we filter for expenses with a cost less than 50.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`cost` < 50\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (cost < 50):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`cost` < 50\n\n* **Main Question (zip code of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`zip` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `expense` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` WHERE `T2`.`cost` < 50\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `expense` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
