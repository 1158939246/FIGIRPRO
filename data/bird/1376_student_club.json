Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among all the closed events, which event has the highest spend-to-budget ratio?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the spend-to-budget ratio for each closed event and then find the maximum ratio. This requires joining the `budget` and `event` tables to access the necessary fields.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `event_name`, MAX(spent / amount) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <closed events> GROUP BY `event_name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** closed events\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table where we select rows with `status` = 'Closed'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'Closed'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (closed events):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'Closed'\n\n* **Main Question (highest spend-to-budget ratio):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`event_name`, MAX(`T1`.`spent` / `T1`.`amount`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T2`.`status` = 'Closed' GROUP BY `T2`.`event_name`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. We will also need to order the results to get the event with the highest ratio.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
