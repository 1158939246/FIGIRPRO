Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (latest created user account):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT Id FROM users WHERE CreationDate = (SELECT MAX(CreationDate) FROM users)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of posts by the user):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE CreationDate = (SELECT MAX(CreationDate) FROM users))\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (count of comments by the user):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE UserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE CreationDate = (SELECT MAX(CreationDate) FROM users))\n\n* **Main Question (total count of posts and comments):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE CreationDate = (SELECT MAX(CreationDate) FROM users))) + (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE UserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE CreationDate = (SELECT MAX(CreationDate) FROM users)))\n\n**3.
