Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many players whose first names are Adam and weigh more than 170?\n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for a count of players with specific conditions on their first name and weight. We will need to filter the `Player` table based on the first name and weight.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` WHERE <first name is Adam> AND <weight > 170>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** first name is Adam\n        * **Analysis:** The first name is part of the `player_name` column in the `Player` table. We will need to extract the first name from the `player_name` string.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `player_name` LIKE 'Adam%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** weight > 170\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `weight` column in the `Player` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `weight` > 170\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (first name is Adam):**\n    * **SQL:** `player_name` LIKE 'Adam%'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (weight > 170):**\n    * **SQL:** `weight` > 170\n\n* **Main Question (count of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Player` WHERE `player_name` LIKE 'Adam%' AND `weight` > 170\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of players meeting the specified conditions without unnecessary joins or subqueries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
