Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the users who obtained the \"Teacher\" badge, calculate their percentage of users.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of users who have the \"Teacher\" badge compared to the total number of users. This involves two counts: one for users with the \"Teacher\" badge and another for the total number of users.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`UserId`) / COUNT(`T2`.`UserId`) * 100) AS percentage FROM `badges` AS `T1`, `users` AS `T2` WHERE <condition for \"Teacher\" badge>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of users with the \"Teacher\" badge\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `badges` table for entries where the badge name is \"Teacher\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`UserId`) WHERE `T1`.`Name` = 'Teacher'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of total users\n        * **Analysis:** This is simply counting all entries in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`UserId`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Count of users with the \"Teacher\" badge):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`UserId`) WHERE `T1`.`Name` = 'Teacher'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Count of total users):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`UserId`)\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`UserId`) * 100.0 / COUNT(`T2`.`UserId`)) AS percentage FROM `badges` AS `T1`, `users` AS `T2` WHERE `T1`.`Name` = 'Teacher'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a `JOIN` to combine the counts in a single query instead of using a Cartesian product. We will use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we count all users even if they don't have the \"Teacher\" badge.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
