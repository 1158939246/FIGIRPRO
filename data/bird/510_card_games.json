Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the cards that don't have multiple faces on the same card, who is the illustrator of the card art that has the highest cost of converted mana?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `artist` of the card with the highest `convertedManaCost` among cards that do not have multiple faces (where `side IS NULL`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `artist` FROM `cards` WHERE <no multiple faces> ORDER BY <highest converted mana cost> LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** no multiple faces\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table where we check if the `side` column is NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `side IS NULL`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest converted mana cost\n        * **Analysis:** We need to order the results by `convertedManaCost` in descending order to find the highest value.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `convertedManaCost` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (no multiple faces):**\n    * **SQL:** `side IS NULL`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest converted mana cost):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `convertedManaCost` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (artist of the card):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `artist` FROM `cards` WHERE `side IS NULL` ORDER BY `convertedManaCost` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are filtering for cards without multiple faces and ordering by the highest converted mana cost, then limiting the result to one entry.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
