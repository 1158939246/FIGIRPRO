We will use the `drivers` table to filter by nationality and date of birth.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `drivers` WHERE <drivers are British> AND <drivers were born in 1980>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** drivers are British\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `nationality` column in the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `nationality` = 'British'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** drivers were born in 1980\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `dob` column to check if the year is 1980. We can use the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year from the date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `dob`) = '1980'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (drivers are British):**\n    * **SQL:** `nationality` = 'British'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (drivers were born in 1980):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `dob`) = '1980'\n\n* **Main Question (count of British drivers born in 1980):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `drivers` WHERE `nationality` = 'British' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `dob`) = '1980'\n\n**3.
