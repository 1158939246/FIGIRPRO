State the account ID and the frequency of statement issuance.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `account_id` and `frequency` from the `account` table for accounts held by clients from the district 'east Bohemia'. This requires joining the `account` table with the `client` table and filtering based on the district name and the date range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id`, `T1`.`frequency` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `client` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <clients are from east Bohemia> AND <account creation date is between 1995 and 2000>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** clients are from east Bohemia\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `client` table based on the district name, which is stored in the `district` table. We will join the `client` table with the `district` table to filter by the district name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` WHERE `A3` = 'east Bohemia')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** account creation date is between 1995 and 2000\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `account` table based on the `date` column, which needs to be checked to fall within the specified range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`date` BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (clients are from east Bohemia):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` WHERE `A3` = 'east Bohemia')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (account creation date is between 1995 and 2000):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`date` BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (account ID and frequency):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`account_id`, `T1`.`frequency` FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `client` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` WHERE `A3` = 'east Bohemia') AND `T1`.`date` BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'\n\n**3.
