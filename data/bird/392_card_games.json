We will limit the results to 3 cards.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <rarity is uncommon> ORDER BY <ruling date> ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** rarity is uncommon\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `rarity` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`rarity` = 'uncommon'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ruling date\n        * **Analysis:** We will order the results based on the `status` column from the `legalities` table, which contains the ruling date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`date` ASC\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause is applied correctly to sort the results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
