Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many credit card withdrawals were recorded after 1995?\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of transactions that are classified as credit card withdrawals and occurred after the year 1995. We will use the `trans` table for this, specifically filtering by the `operation` column and the `date` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `trans` WHERE <credit card withdrawals> AND <date after 1995>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** credit card withdrawals\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `operation` column in the `trans` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `operation` = 'VYBER KARTOU'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date after 1995\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `trans` table based on the `date` column. We will check if the date is greater than '1995-12-31'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `date` > '1995-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (credit card withdrawals):**\n    * **SQL:** `operation` = 'VYBER KARTOU'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date after 1995):**\n    * **SQL:** `date` > '1995-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (count of credit card withdrawals):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `trans` WHERE `operation` = 'VYBER KARTOU' AND `date` > '1995-12-31'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of records in the `trans` table that meet both conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
