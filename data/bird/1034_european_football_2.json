Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the players' api id who had the highest above average overall ratings in 2010.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the players' API IDs from the `Player_Attributes` table who had an overall rating above the average for the year 2010.

This can be done by filtering the `Player_Attributes` table for records where the year extracted from the `date` column is 2010 and then using the `AVG()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE substr(`date`, 1, 4) = '2010'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** year is 2010\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will be applied in the main query to filter the records for the year 2010.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** substr(`date`, 1, 4) = '2010'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average overall rating for 2010):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE substr(`date`, 1, 4) = '2010'\n\n* **Main Question (players' api id with highest above average overall ratings):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `player_api_id` FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE `overall_rating` > (SELECT AVG(`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE substr(`date`, 1, 4) = '2010') AND substr(`date`, 1, 4) = '2010'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to calculate the average overall rating for 2010 and then filtering the main query based on this average.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
