Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Identify the number of adult users who have cast over 5000 upvotes.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count users who meet two criteria: they are adults (age between 19 and 65) and they have cast more than 5000 upvotes. We will use the `users` table for this.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE <adult users> AND <over 5000 upvotes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** adult users\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Age` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** over 5000 upvotes\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `UpVotes` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `UpVotes` > 5000\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (adult users):**\n    * **SQL:** `Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (over 5000 upvotes):**\n    * **SQL:** `UpVotes` > 5000\n\n* **Main Question (count of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE `Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65 AND `UpVotes` > 5000\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly counts the number of users that meet both conditions without any unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
