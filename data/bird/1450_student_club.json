The `income` table contains the income records, and we will need to join it with the `attendance` table to link incomes to events. The `event` table will provide the location details (city and country).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `city`, `country` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_member` = `T3`.`link_to_member` WHERE <more than 40 incomes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** more than 40 incomes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of incomes associated with each event and filter those with a count greater than 40.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T3`.`income_id`) > 40\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (more than 40 incomes):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T3`.`income_id`) > 40\n\n* **Main Question (city and country of events):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`city`, `T1`.`country` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` INNER JOIN `income` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_member` = `T3`.`link_to_member` GROUP BY `T1`.`event_id` HAVING COUNT(`T3`.`income_id`) > 40\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `HAVING` clause effectively filters for events with more than 40 incomes.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
