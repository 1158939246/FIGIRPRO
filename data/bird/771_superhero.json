Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the name of superheroes with flight power.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table where the superhero has the power of flight. This requires joining the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table to filter by the specific power.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <flight power>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** flight power\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superpower` table where we check for the `power_name` equal to 'Flight'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`power_name` = 'Flight'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (flight power):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`power_name` = 'Flight'\n\n* **Main Question (names of superheroes with flight power):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T3`.`power_name` = 'Flight'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
