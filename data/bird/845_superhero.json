Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the power of superheroes with height greater than 80% of the average height of all superheroes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `power_name` from the `superpower` table for superheroes whose height exceeds 80% of the average height. This requires calculating the average height from the `superhero` table and filtering based on that.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`height_cm` > (SELECT AVG(`height_cm`) * 0.8 FROM `superhero`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate average height\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward calculation using the `AVG()` function on the `height_cm` column from the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`height_cm`) FROM `superhero`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average height):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`height_cm`) FROM `superhero`\n\n* **Main Question (list power names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`power_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `hero_power` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id` = `T2`.`hero_id` INNER JOIN `superpower` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`power_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`height_cm` > (SELECT AVG(`height_cm`) * 0.8 FROM `superhero`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to connect the tables based on their relationships, and the filtering condition is clearly defined.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
