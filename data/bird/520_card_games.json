List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the artist who has illustrated the least number of cards and then list the formats of play for those cards. This requires counting the number of cards illustrated by each artist and then finding the minimum count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`artist`, `T1`.`format` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <least amount of cards by artist>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** least amount of cards by artist\n        * **Analysis:** We need to group by artist and count the number of cards they illustrated, then find the artist with the minimum count.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`artist` IN (SELECT `artist` FROM `cards` GROUP BY `artist` ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1)\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `cards` and `legalities` tables and filtering for the artist with the minimum count of cards illustrated.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
