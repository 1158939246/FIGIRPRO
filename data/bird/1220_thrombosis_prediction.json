This requires a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`BIRTHDAY` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <urea nitrogen is 29>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** urea nitrogen is 29\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `UN` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`UN` = 29\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (urea nitrogen is 29):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`UN` = 29\n\n* **Main Question (ID, sex, and birthday):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`BIRTHDAY` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`UN` = 29\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
