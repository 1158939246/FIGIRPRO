Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State the number of views of users who obtained the badge on 7/19/2010 7:39:08 PM.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the number of views associated with users who obtained a badge at a specific date. This involves joining the `badges` table with the `users` table to access the `views` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`views`) FROM `users` AS `U` INNER JOIN `badges` AS `B` ON `U`.`Id` = `B`.`UserId` WHERE `B`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter by badge date\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `badges` table using the `Date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `B`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (badge date):**\n    * **SQL:** `B`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n* **Main Question (number of views):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`U`.`views`) FROM `users` AS `U` INNER JOIN `badges` AS `B` ON `U`.`Id` = `B`.`UserId` WHERE `B`.`Date` = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `users` and `badges` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
