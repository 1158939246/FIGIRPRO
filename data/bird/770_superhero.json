This requires joining the `superhero` and `colour` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Abraham Sapien'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the eye colour\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward join between the `superhero` and `colour` tables, filtering by the superhero's full name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`full_name` = 'Abraham Sapien'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify the eye colour):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`full_name` = 'Abraham Sapien'\n\n* **Main Question (retrieve eye colour):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Abraham Sapien'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
