Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Name the ID of the patient who is born on the April 1st, 1982. Is his/her alkaliphophatase (ALP) within normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `ID` of the patient from the `Patient` table based on the birth date and check the `ALP` value from the `Laboratory` table to see if it is within the normal range.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `P`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <patient born on April 1st, 1982> AND <ALP within normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** patient born on April 1st, 1982\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`Birthday` = '1982-04-01'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ALP within normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking the `ALP` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it is less than 300.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`ALP` < 300\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patient born on April 1st, 1982):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`Birthday` = '1982-04-01'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ALP within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`ALP` < 300\n\n* **Main Question (ID of the patient):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `P`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`Birthday` = '1982-04-01' AND `L`.`ALP` < 300\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
