Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the constructor which got the highest point in the race No. 9, what is its introduction website?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the constructor that achieved the maximum points in race No. 9, and then retrieve its introduction website from the `constructors` table. This requires a join between the `constructorResults` and `constructors` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `url` FROM `constructors` WHERE `constructorId` = (SELECT `constructorId` FROM `constructorResults` WHERE `raceId` = 9 ORDER BY `points` DESC LIMIT 1)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the constructorId with the highest points in race No. 9  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves selecting the `constructorId` from the `constructorResults` table where `raceId` is 9, and ordering by `points` in descending order to get the highest.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `constructorId` FROM `constructorResults` WHERE `raceId` = 9 ORDER BY `points` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (constructorId with highest points in race No. 9):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `constructorId` FROM `constructorResults` WHERE `raceId` = 9 ORDER BY `points` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Main Question (introduction website of the constructor):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `url` FROM `constructors` WHERE `constructorId` = (SELECT `constructorId` FROM `constructorResults` WHERE `raceId` = 9 ORDER BY `points` DESC LIMIT 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the `constructorId` with the highest points in race No. 9 and then using that to retrieve the corresponding `url` from the `constructors` table.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
