Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the patient's ID if he or she has an abnormal level of red blood cell and is followed at the outpatient clinic.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter patients based on two conditions: abnormal levels of red blood cells and the admission status indicating they are followed at the outpatient clinic. The `Patient` table contains the `ID` and `Admission` columns, while the `Laboratory` table contains the `RBC` levels.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <abnormal RBC levels> AND <followed at outpatient clinic>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal RBC levels\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be expressed using the `RBC` column from the `Laboratory` table. We need to check if `RBC` is less than or equal to 3.5 or greater than or equal to 6.0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`RBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`RBC` >= 6.0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** followed at outpatient clinic\n        * **Analysis:** This condition is straightforward and can be checked directly in the `Patient` table using the `Admission` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal RBC levels):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`RBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`RBC` >= 6.0\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (followed at outpatient clinic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (patient IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE (`T2`.`RBC` <= 3.5 OR `T2`.`RBC` >= 6.0) AND `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
