The ranking information is found in the `driverStandings` table, which we will join with the `drivers` table to get the required names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `driverStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <born after 1975> AND <ranked 2>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born after 1975\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `dob` column in the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`dob`) > 1975\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ranked 2\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `position` column in the `driverStandings` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`position` = 2\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born after 1975):**\n    * **SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`dob`) > 1975\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ranked 2):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`position` = 2\n\n* **Main Question (forenames and surnames of drivers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `driverStandings` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE YEAR(`T1`.`dob`) > 1975 AND `T2`.`position` = 2\n\n**3.
