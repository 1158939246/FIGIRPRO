Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please provide top three sets that don't appear in Magic: The Gathering Online, along with their names in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the names of sets where the `mtgoCode` is either NULL or an empty string. We will then order these sets alphabetically and limit the results to the top three.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `sets` WHERE <sets don't appear in Magic: The Gathering Online> ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** sets don't appear in Magic: The Gathering Online\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `mtgoCode` column in the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `mtgoCode IS NULL OR mtgoCode = ''`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (sets don't appear in Magic: The Gathering Online):**\n    * **SQL:** `mtgoCode IS NULL OR mtgoCode = ''`\n\n* **Main Question (top three sets):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `sets` WHERE `mtgoCode` IS NULL OR `mtgoCode` = '' ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `sets` table based on the `mtgoCode` condition and orders the results alphabetically.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
