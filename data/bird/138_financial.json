Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In the branch where the second-highest number of crimes were committed in 1995 occurred, how many male clients are there?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the count of male clients in the district with the second-highest number of crimes committed in 1995. This requires two steps: first, identify the district with the second-highest number of crimes, and then count the male clients in that district.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client WHERE <gender = 'M'> AND <district_id = (district with second-highest crimes)>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** gender = 'M'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `client` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** gender = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** district with second-highest crimes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to select the `district_id` from the `district` table where `A15` (number of committed crimes in 1995) is the second-highest. We can achieve this by ordering the districts by `A15` in descending order and limiting the result to 1.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (SELECT district_id FROM district ORDER BY A15 DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (gender = 'M'):**\n    * **SQL:** gender = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (district with second-highest crimes):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT district_id FROM district ORDER BY A15 DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)\n\n* **Main Question (count of male clients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client WHERE gender = 'M' AND district_id = (SELECT district_id FROM district ORDER BY A15 DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the district with the second-highest number of crimes and filtering the `client` table based on that.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
