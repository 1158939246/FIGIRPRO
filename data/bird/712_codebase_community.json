Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the post ID and the comments commented in the post titled by \"Group differences on a five point Likert item\"? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `Id` from the `posts` table and the corresponding comments from the `comments` table. This requires joining the two tables based on the `PostId` in the `comments` table and the `Id` in the `posts` table. We will filter the posts by the specified title.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Id`, `T2`.`Text` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `comments` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` WHERE `T1`.`Title` = 'Group differences on a five point Likert item'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter by title\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `Title` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Title` = 'Group differences on a five point Likert item'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (filter by title):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Title` = 'Group differences on a five point Likert item'\n\n* **Main Question (post ID and comments):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Id`, `T2`.`Text` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `comments` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Id` = `T2`.`PostId` WHERE `T1`.`Title` = 'Group differences on a five point Likert item'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `posts` and `comments` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
