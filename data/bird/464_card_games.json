This requires joining the `cards`, `sets`, and `set_translations` tables to filter by the translation and retrieve the card names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`code` = `T3`.`setCode` WHERE `T3`.`translation` = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter by translation\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `set_translations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`translation` = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition'\n\n**2.
