Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which active district has the highest average score in Reading?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the district with the highest average score in Reading. The relevant columns are `dname` for the district name and `AvgScrRead` for the average reading score. We also need to ensure that we only consider active districts, which can be inferred from the `StatusType` column in the `schools` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`dname` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE <active district> ORDER BY `AvgScrRead` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** active district\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will check if the `StatusType` in the `schools` table indicates that the district is active.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`StatusType` = 'Active'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (active district):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`StatusType` = 'Active'\n\n* **Main Question (highest average score in Reading):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`dname` FROM `satscores` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`cds` = `T2`.`CDSCode` WHERE `T2`.`StatusType` = 'Active' ORDER BY `T1`.`AvgScrRead` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for active districts. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to find the highest average score.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
