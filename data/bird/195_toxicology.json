We will need to count the occurrences of each bond type and then find the maximum count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `bond_type` FROM `bond` GROUP BY `bond_type` ORDER BY COUNT(`bond_type`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count occurrences of each bond type\n        * **Analysis:** This involves grouping the `bond` table by `bond_type` and counting the number of occurrences for each type.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`bond_type`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count occurrences of each bond type):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`bond_type`)\n\n* **Main Question (most common bond type):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `bond_type` FROM `bond` GROUP BY `bond_type` ORDER BY COUNT(`bond_type`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `GROUP BY` to aggregate the bond types and `ORDER BY` to sort them by their counts in descending order, limiting the result to the most common bond type.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
