Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For laboratory examinations taken in 1984, list all patients below 50 years old with normal platelet level.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Laboratory` table for examinations taken in 1984, and then join it with the `Patient` table to get patient details. We will filter patients based on their age and platelet levels.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`ID` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <examinations in 1984> AND <patients below 50 years old> AND <normal platelet level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** examinations in 1984\n        * **Analysis:** This can be filtered directly using the `Date` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`Date`) = '1984'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** patients below 50 years old\n        * **Analysis:** We will calculate the age based on the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table and filter accordingly.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`)) < 50\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** normal platelet level\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `PLT` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it falls within the normal range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` BETWEEN 100 AND 400\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (examinations in 1984):**\n    * **SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`Date`) = '1984'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (patients below 50 years old):**\n    * **SQL:** (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`)) < 50\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (normal platelet level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` BETWEEN 100 AND 400\n\n* **Main Question (list of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`ID` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE YEAR(`T1`.`Date`) = '1984' AND (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Birthday`)) < 50 AND `T1`.`PLT` BETWEEN 100 AND 400\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
