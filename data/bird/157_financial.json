To get the correct district, we need to join the `account` table to the `district` table using the `district_id` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`A15` FROM `district` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`account_id` = 532\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (number of committed crimes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`A15` FROM `district` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`account_id` = 532\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `account` and `district` tables based on their relationship, and we are filtering by the specific `account_id`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
