We will need to join the `cards` and `legalities` tables based on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`uuid`), `T2`.`status` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <future frame version> AND <legality status>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** future frame version\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `frameVersion` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`frameVersion` = 'future'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** legality status\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the legality status from the `legalities` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'legal'\n\n**2.
