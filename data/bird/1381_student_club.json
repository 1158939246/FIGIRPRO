Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the name of students that have attended more than 7 events.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the full names of students (first_name and last_name) from the `member` table and filter based on their attendance in events, which is tracked in the `attendance` table. We will use a `JOIN` to connect these two tables and apply a `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of events attended by each student.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` GROUP BY `T1`.`member_id` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`) > 7\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of events attended\n        * **Analysis:** This is handled in the `HAVING` clause where we count the `link_to_event` from the `attendance` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`) > 7\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of events attended):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`) > 7\n\n* **Main Question (names of students):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`member_id` = `T2`.`link_to_member` GROUP BY `T1`.`member_id` HAVING COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`) > 7\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `attendance` tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause effectively filters for students who have attended more than 7 events.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
