Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (release date is 2017/6/9):**\n    * **SQL:** `releaseDate` = '2017-06-09'\n\n* **Main Question (magic card market name):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `mcmName` FROM `sets` WHERE `releaseDate` = '2017-06-09'\n\n**3.

It directly retrieves the required `mcmName` based on the specified release date.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
