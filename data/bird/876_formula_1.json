Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the race happened in 2015/11/29, how many drivers did not finish the game?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of drivers who did not finish the race on the specified date. This can be determined by checking the `results` table for records where the `time` field is NULL, indicating that the driver did not finish.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `results` WHERE <drivers did not finish> AND <race date is 2015/11/29>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** drivers did not finish\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition where we check if the `time` column in the `results` table is NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `time` IS NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race date is 2015/11/29\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `results` table with the `races` table to filter by the race date. The date can be found in the `date` column of the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '2015-11-29')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (drivers did not finish):**\n    * **SQL:** `time` IS NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race date is 2015/11/29):**\n    * **SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '2015-11-29')\n\n* **Main Question (count of drivers who did not finish):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `results` WHERE `time` IS NULL AND `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `date` = '2015-11-29')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to filter the results based on the race date and checking for NULL values in the `time` column.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
