Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What percentage of bonds have the most common combination of atoms' elements?\n    * **Analysis:** To find the percentage, we need to calculate the count of bonds and the count of atoms for the most common combination of elements. This requires two main calculations: the total number of bonds and the most common combination of atom elements.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`bond_id`) / <count of atoms for most common combination>) * 100 AS percentage FROM `bond` AS `T1`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of bonds\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward; we can directly count the `bond_id` from the `bond` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`bond_id`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of atoms for the most common combination of elements\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `atom` and `connected` tables to find the combinations of elements for each bond. We will group by the combination of elements and count them to find the most common one.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` GROUP BY `T2`.`element` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of bonds):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`bond_id`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of atoms for the most common combination):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` GROUP BY `T2`.`element` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) DESC LIMIT 1)\n\n* **Main Question (percentage of bonds):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(`T1`.`bond_id`) / (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) FROM `connected` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `atom` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` GROUP BY `T2`.`element` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`atom_id`) DESC LIMIT 1)) * 100 AS percentage FROM `bond` AS `T1`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly calculating the counts in a single query without nesting. We can use a common table expression (CTE) to first calculate the most common combination of elements and then use that in the main query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
