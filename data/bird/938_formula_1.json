Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Who was the champion of 2008's Australian Grand Prix and where can I know more about him?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to find the driver's name who won the 2008 Australian Grand Prix and the corresponding URL for more information.

We need to filter for the winning position, which is typically `position = 1`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race is 2008 Australian Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `results` table with the `races` table to filter for the specific race. The race can be identified by the year (2008) and the name (Australian Grand Prix).\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2008 AND `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (champion's finished time):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race is 2008 Australian Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2008 AND `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix')\n\n* **Main Question (champion's name and URL):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`forename`, `T2`.`surname`, `T2`.`url` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`position` = 1 AND `T1`.`raceId` = (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2008 AND `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `results` and `drivers` tables based on the driver ID, and we are filtering the results based on the winning position and the specific race.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
