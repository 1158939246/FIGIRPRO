Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the age gap between the youngest and oldest patient with a normal triglyceride recorded?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate the age gap, which involves finding the maximum and minimum birth years of patients who have a triglyceride level of 200 or more. We will use the `Birthday` column from the `Patient` table and the `TG` column from the `Laboratory` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(year(Birthday)) - MIN(year(Birthday)) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <normal triglyceride condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal triglyceride condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the records based on the triglyceride level, which is represented by the `TG` column in the `Laboratory` table. The condition is that `TG` should be greater than or equal to 200.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`TG` >= 200\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal triglyceride condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`TG` >= 200\n\n* **Main Question (age gap calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(STRFTIME('%Y', `P`.`Birthday`)) - MIN(STRFTIME('%Y', `P`.`Birthday`)) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `L`.`TG` >= 200\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
