Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which user made a post titled 'Understanding what Dassault iSight is doing?' and how much is the reputation of the user?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `DisplayName` of the user who made the post with the specified title and also retrieve the user's `Reputation`. This requires joining the `posts` table with the `users` table based on the `OwnerUserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`DisplayName`, `T2`.`Reputation` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Title` = 'Understanding what Dassault iSight is doing?'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the post with the specified title.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `posts` table using the `Title` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Title` = 'Understanding what Dassault iSight is doing?'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (post with specified title):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Title` = 'Understanding what Dassault iSight is doing?'\n\n* **Main Question (user and reputation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`DisplayName`, `T2`.`Reputation` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Title` = 'Understanding what Dassault iSight is doing?'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `posts` and `users` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
