This requires us to join the `posts` and `comments` tables and apply the necessary filters.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`C`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE <posts have 1 comment> AND <comments have 0 score>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** posts have 1 comment\n        * **Analysis:** This can be determined by filtering on the `CommentCount` column in the `posts` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`CommentCount` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** comments have 0 score\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Score` column in the `comments` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `C`.`Score` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (posts have 1 comment):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`CommentCount` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (comments have 0 score):**\n    * **SQL:** `C`.`Score` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (count of comments with 0 score):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`C`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `C` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `P` ON `C`.`PostId` = `P`.`Id` WHERE `P`.`CommentCount` = 1 AND `C`.`Score` = 0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `comments` and `posts` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
