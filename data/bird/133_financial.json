List their branch location and district name.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the district names and their corresponding branch locations based on the highest unemployment rates in 1996. This requires filtering the `district` table for the unemployment rate and joining it with the `account` table to get the branch locations.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`A2`, `T1`.`district_id`, `T2`.`district_id` FROM `district` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <unemployment rate condition> ORDER BY <unemployment rate> DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** unemployment rate condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the districts based on the unemployment rate in 1996, which is represented by the `A13` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`A13` IS NOT NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** order by unemployment rate\n        * **Analysis:** We will order the results by the unemployment rate in descending order to get the highest rates first.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`A13` DESC\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (unemployment rate condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`A13` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (order by unemployment rate):**\n    * **SQL:** ORDER BY `T1`.`A13` DESC\n\n* **Main Question (districts with highest unemployment rate):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`A2`, `T1`.`district_id` FROM `district` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`A13` IS NOT NULL ORDER BY `T1`.`A13` DESC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `district` and `account` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. \n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
