This requires a join between the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_long_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeedClass` = 'Fast'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (team names with speed class fast):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_long_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`buildUpPlaySpeedClass` = 'Fast'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
