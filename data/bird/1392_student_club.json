Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Indicate the top source of funds received in September 2019 based on their amount.\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for the maximum source of funds, which implies we need to aggregate the data based on the `source` column in the `income` table. We will filter the records to include only those received in September 2019.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(source) FROM income WHERE <date received in September 2019>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** date received in September 2019\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `income` table using the `date_received` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** date_received BETWEEN '2019-09-01' AND '2019-09-30'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (date received in September 2019):**\n    * **SQL:** date_received BETWEEN '2019-09-01' AND '2019-09-30'\n\n* **Main Question (top source of funds):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(source) FROM income WHERE date_received BETWEEN '2019-09-01' AND '2019-09-30'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already quite efficient. We are directly filtering the `income` table based on the date and then applying the `MAX()` function to the `source` column.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
