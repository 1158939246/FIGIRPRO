The relevant column for enrollment is `Enrollment (K-12)` from the `frpm` table. We will also need to join this table with the `schools` table to get the corresponding city names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `City`, `Enrollment (K-12)` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (top 5 lowest enrollment):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`City`, `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` FROM `frpm` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `schools` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`CDSCode` ORDER BY `T1`.`Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `frpm` and `schools` tables based on their relationship, and we are ordering by the enrollment number to get the top 5 lowest values.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
