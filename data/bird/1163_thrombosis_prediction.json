We need to find the minimum age among all patients.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MIN(YEAR(`First Date`) - YEAR(Birthday)) FROM Patient WHERE <valid dates>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** valid dates\n        * **Analysis:** We need to ensure that both `First Date` and `Birthday` are not NULL to perform the age calculation.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `First Date` IS NOT NULL AND `Birthday` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (valid dates):**\n    * **SQL:** `First Date` IS NOT NULL AND `Birthday` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (age of the youngest patient):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MIN(YEAR(`First Date`) - YEAR(Birthday)) FROM Patient WHERE `First Date` IS NOT NULL AND `Birthday` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3.
