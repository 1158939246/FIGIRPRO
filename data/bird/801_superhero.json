Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find the ratio between male superheroes and female superheroes.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to calculate a ratio of counts of male and female superheroes. We need to sum the counts of each gender based on the `gender_id` in the `superhero` table, which references the `gender` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS ratio FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of male superheroes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count superheroes where `gender_id` corresponds to male.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of female superheroes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count superheroes where `gender_id` corresponds to female.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Count of male superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Count of female superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n\n* **Main Question (ratio of male to female superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / SUM(CASE WHEN `gender_id` = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS ratio FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `gender` tables based on their relationship, and the `SUM` with `CASE` statements allows us to count the genders directly.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
