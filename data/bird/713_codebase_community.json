This requires joining the `comments` table with the `users` table based on the `UserId` to access the `UpVotes` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`UpVotes` FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <comment text matches>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** comment text matches  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the comments based on the specific text \"R is also lazy evaluated.\"  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Text` = 'R is also lazy evaluated.'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (comment text matches):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Text` = 'R is also lazy evaluated.'\n\n* **Main Question (up vote number):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`UpVotes` FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`UserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Text` = 'R is also lazy evaluated.'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `comments` and `users` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
