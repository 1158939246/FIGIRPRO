We need to filter the data based on the category and the event name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`spent`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <category is Advertisement> AND <event name is September Meeting>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** category is Advertisement  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `budget` table using the `category` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`category` = 'Advertisement'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** event name is September Meeting  \n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `event` table using the `event_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`event_name` = 'September Meeting'\n\n**2.
