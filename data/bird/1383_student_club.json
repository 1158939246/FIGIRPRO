Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** State the name of students from Georgetown, South Carolina.  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the full names of students, which are composed of `first_name` and `last_name` from the `member` table. To filter the students based on their location, we need to join the `member` table with the `zip_code` table to access the `city` and `state` information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE <city is Georgetown> AND <state is South Carolina>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** city is Georgetown  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `zip_code` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`city` = 'Georgetown'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** state is South Carolina  \n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `zip_code` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`state` = 'South Carolina'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (city is Georgetown):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`city` = 'Georgetown'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (state is South Carolina):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`state` = 'South Carolina'\n\n* **Main Question (names of students):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`first_name`, `T1`.`last_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `zip_code` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`zip` = `T2`.`zip_code` WHERE `T2`.`city` = 'Georgetown' AND `T2`.`state` = 'South Carolina'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `zip_code` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
