We need to join the `Player_Attributes` table with the `Player` table to filter by the player's name and then apply the `MAX()` function on the `overall_rating` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <Dorlan Pabon>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Dorlan Pabon\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player` table using the `player_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`player_name` = 'Dorlan Pabon'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Dorlan Pabon):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`player_name` = 'Dorlan Pabon'\n\n* **Main Question (highest overall rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T1`.`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`player_name` = 'Dorlan Pabon'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
