Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all patients who were followed up at the outpatient clinic who underwent a laboratory test in October 1991 and had a total blood bilirubin level within the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select patient information from the `Patient` table and filter based on three criteria: the admission status, the date of the laboratory test, and the total blood bilirubin level.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <followed up at the outpatient clinic> AND <laboratory test in October 1991> AND <total blood bilirubin level within normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** followed up at the outpatient clinic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** laboratory test in October 1991\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `Date` column in the `Laboratory` table using the `LIKE` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Date` LIKE '1991-10%'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** total blood bilirubin level within the normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This filter applies to the `T-BIL` column in the `Laboratory` table, where we need to check if the value is less than 2.0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`T-BIL` < 2.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (followed up at the outpatient clinic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (laboratory test in October 1991):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Date` LIKE '1991-10%'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (total blood bilirubin level within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`T-BIL` < 2.0\n\n* **Main Question (list of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Admission` = '-' AND `T2`.`Date` LIKE '1991-10%' AND `T2`.`T-BIL` < 2.0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
