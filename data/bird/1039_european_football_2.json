Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find the average number of long-shot done by Ahmed Samir Farag.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average number of long shots for the player named \"Ahmed Samir Farag\". This involves summing the `long_shots` and counting the number of entries for this player in the `Player_Attributes` table. We will need to join the `Player` table to get the player's `player_fifa_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(`long_shots`), COUNT(`player_fifa_api_id`)) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `T2`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`player_name` = 'Ahmed Samir Farag'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Sum of long shots\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation on the `long_shots` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`T1`.`long_shots`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of player_fifa_api_id\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of entries for Ahmed Samir Farag in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`player_fifa_api_id`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Sum of long shots):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`T1`.`long_shots`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Count of player_fifa_api_id):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`player_fifa_api_id`)\n\n* **Main Question (average number of long shots):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(`T1`.`long_shots`), COUNT(`T1`.`player_fifa_api_id`)) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `T2`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`player_name` = 'Ahmed Samir Farag'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the `player_fifa_api_id`, and the `WHERE` clause filters for the specific player.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
