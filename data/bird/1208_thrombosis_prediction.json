Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide IDs for male patients with ALT glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) that have a history of ALT glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) exceeding the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter for male patients and check their GPT values in the `Laboratory` table. We will join the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID. The filtering criteria will include both the sex of the patient and the GPT value.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <GPT exceeds normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** GPT exceeds normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will be applied to the `Laboratory` table using the `GPT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GPT` >= 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (GPT exceeds normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GPT` >= 60\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of male patients with high GPT):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `T2`.`GPT` >= 60\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
