Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For patients with alkaliphophatase (ALP) within normal range, were they treated as inpatient or outpatient?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to determine the treatment type (inpatient or outpatient) for patients whose ALP levels are below 300. This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table for ALP values and then checking the corresponding `Admission` status from the `Patient` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Admission` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <ALP within normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** ALP within normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table where we select rows with `ALP < 300`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`ALP` < 300\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (ALP within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`ALP` < 300\n\n* **Main Question (treatment type):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Admission` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`ALP` < 300\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
