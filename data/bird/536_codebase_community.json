Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many users with more than 10 views created their account after the year 2013?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count users based on two conditions: they must have more than 10 views and their account must have been created after 2013. We will use the `users` table for this.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE <more than 10 views> AND <created after the year 2013>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** more than 10 views\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Views` column in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Views` > 10\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** created after the year 2013\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `CreationDate` column to ensure it is greater than the last day of 2013.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate)` > 2013\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (more than 10 views):**\n    * **SQL:** `Views` > 10\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (created after the year 2013):**\n    * **SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate)` > 2013\n\n* **Main Question (count of users):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` WHERE `Views` > 10 AND `STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate)` > 2013\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly counting users based on the specified conditions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
