Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the speed in which attacks are put together of the top 4 teams with the highest build Up Play Speed? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `buildUpPlaySpeed` for the top 4 teams based on their `buildUpPlaySpeed`.

Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (top 4 teams' build up play speed):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`buildUpPlaySpeed` FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T1` ORDER BY `T1`.`buildUpPlaySpeed` DESC LIMIT 4\n\n**3.
