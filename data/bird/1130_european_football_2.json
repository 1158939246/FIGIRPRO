Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the short name of team who played safe while creating chance of passing? \n    * **Analysis:** The question is asking for the `team_short_name` from the `Team` table where the `chanceCreationPassingClass` in the `Team_Attributes` table is 'Safe'. This requires a join between the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables based on `team_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE <chanceCreationPassingClass = 'Safe'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** chanceCreationPassingClass = 'Safe'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Safe'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (chanceCreationPassingClass = 'Safe'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Safe'\n\n* **Main Question (short name of team):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Safe'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
