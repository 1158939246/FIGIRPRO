Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which element is the least numerous in non-carcinogenic molecules?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the occurrences of each element in non-carcinogenic molecules and find the minimum count. The `molecule` table will help us filter for non-carcinogenic molecules using the `label` column, and the `atom` table will provide the elements associated with those molecules.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `element`, COUNT(`element`) FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE <non-carcinogenic> GROUP BY `element` ORDER BY COUNT(`element`) ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** non-carcinogenic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `molecule` table using the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (non-carcinogenic):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`label` = '-'\n\n* **Main Question (least numerous element):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`element`, COUNT(`T1`.`element`) FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `molecule` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`molecule_id` = `T2`.`molecule_id` WHERE `T2`.`label` = '-' GROUP BY `T1`.`element` ORDER BY COUNT(`T1`.`element`) ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `atom` and `molecule` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to find the least numerous element.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
