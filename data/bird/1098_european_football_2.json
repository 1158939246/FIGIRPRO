This requires joining the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables based on the `team_api_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T2`.`chanceCreationPassing`), `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Ajax'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum chance creation passing score for Ajax.\n        * **Analysis:** This is part of the main query and will be handled in the aggregation.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`T2`.`chanceCreationPassing`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Retrieve the classification for the maximum chance creation passing score.\n        * **Analysis:** This will also be handled in the main query, as we will select `chanceCreationPassingClass` alongside the maximum score.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum chance creation passing score):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`T2`.`chanceCreationPassing`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (classification):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass`\n\n* **Main Question (Ajax's highest chance creation passing score and classification):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T2`.`chanceCreationPassing`), `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`team_long_name` = 'Ajax'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria for the team name.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
