Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** From 2000 to 2005, what percentage of drivers who were born before 1985 and the lap numbers were over 50?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage of drivers who meet two criteria: they were born before 1985 and completed more than 50 laps. We will also need to count the total number of drivers who participated in races between 2000 and 2005.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(<drivers born before 1985 and laps > 50>) * 100.0 / COUNT(<drivers in races from 2000 to 2005>)) AS percentage\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** drivers born before 1985 and laps > 50\n        * **Analysis:** We will join the `drivers`, `lapTimes`, and `races` tables to filter drivers based on their birth year and the number of laps they completed.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `lapTimes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE year(`T1`.`dob`) < 1985 AND `T2`.`lap` > 50\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** drivers in races from 2000 to 2005\n        * **Analysis:** We will count the distinct drivers who participated in races held between 2000 and 2005.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `lapTimes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE year(`T3`.`year`) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (drivers born before 1985 and laps > 50):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `lapTimes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE year(`T1`.`dob`) < 1985 AND `T2`.`lap` > 50\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (drivers in races from 2000 to 2005):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `lapTimes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE year(`T3`.`year`) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `lapTimes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE year(`T1`.`dob`) < 1985 AND `T2`.`lap` > 50) * 100.0 / (COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `lapTimes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`raceId` = `T3`.`raceId` WHERE year(`T3`.`year`) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by combining the calculations into a single query with a `WITH` clause to improve readability and performance.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
