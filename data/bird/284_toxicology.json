Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Determine the bond type that is formed in the chemical compound containing element Carbon.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the bond type associated with the atoms that contain the element Carbon. This requires joining the `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables to get the relevant bond types.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T4`.`bond_type` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`bond_id` = `T3`.`bond_id` WHERE `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify atoms with element Carbon\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `atom` table using the `element` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Get bond types for these atoms\n        * **Analysis:** We will join the `connected` table to find the bonds associated with the Carbon atoms and then join the `bond` table to get the bond types.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`bond_id` IN (SELECT `T3`.`bond_id` FROM `bond` AS `T3`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify atoms with element Carbon):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Get bond types for these atoms):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`bond_id` IN (SELECT `T3`.`bond_id` FROM `bond` AS `T3`)\n\n* **Main Question (bond type for Carbon):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T4`.`bond_type` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`bond_id` = `T3`.`bond_id` WHERE `T1`.`element` = 'c'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
