This requires us to join the `superhero` table with the `publisher` table based on the `publisher_id` and filter by the publisher name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <publisher_name = 'DC Comics'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** publisher_name = 'DC Comics'  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `publisher` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`publisher_name` = 'DC Comics'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (publisher_name = 'DC Comics'):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`publisher_name` = 'DC Comics'\n\n* **Main Question (count of superheroes):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`publisher_name` = 'DC Comics'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
