Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What type of label is not on molecules with atoms with tin?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to identify the labels of molecules that do not have any atoms with the element 'sn' (tin). The labels are stored in the `molecule` table. We will need to join the `molecule`, `atom`, and `connected` tables to filter out the relevant molecules.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`label` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` WHERE <molecule does not have atoms with tin>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** molecule does not have atoms with tin  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter out molecules that have any associated atoms with the element 'sn'. This can be done by checking if the `molecule_id` exists in the `atom` table where the `element` is 'sn'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`molecule_id` NOT IN (SELECT `T2`.`molecule_id` FROM `atom` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`element` = 'sn')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (molecule does not have atoms with tin):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`molecule_id` NOT IN (SELECT `T2`.`molecule_id` FROM `atom` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`element` = 'sn')\n\n* **Main Question (labels of molecules without tin):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`label` FROM `molecule` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`molecule_id` NOT IN (SELECT `T2`.`molecule_id` FROM `atom` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`element` = 'sn')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to filter out molecules that contain tin atoms. There are no unnecessary joins or columns included.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
