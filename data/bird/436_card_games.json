List out the id of those cards.\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for the count of cards with a specific frame effect and also requests the IDs of those cards. We will need to filter the `cards` table based on the `frameEffects` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`id`), `id` FROM `cards` WHERE <frame effect is extendedart>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** frame effect is extendedart\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `frameEffects` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `frameEffects` = 'extendedart'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (frame effect is extendedart):**\n    * **SQL:** `frameEffects` = 'extendedart'\n\n* **Main Question (count of cards and their IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`id`), `id` FROM `cards` WHERE `frameEffects` = 'extendedart'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 needs to be adjusted to ensure we can list the IDs of the cards while also counting them. We can achieve this by using a `GROUP BY` clause to group by the card ID.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
