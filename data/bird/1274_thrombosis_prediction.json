This involves filtering based on the `SSB` column in the `Laboratory` table and checking for non-null values in the `Symptoms` column in the `Examination` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <anti-SSB normal> AND <other symptoms observed>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** anti-SSB normal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `SSB` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SSB` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** other symptoms observed\n        * **Analysis:** This involves checking the `Symptoms` column in the `Examination` table to ensure it is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Laboratory` and `Examination` tables based on the patient ID, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
