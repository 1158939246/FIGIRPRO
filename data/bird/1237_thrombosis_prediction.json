State the different IDs and their sex.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` and `SEX` of patients who are outpatients and have a low hemoglobin level. This requires filtering based on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table and the `HGB` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <outpatients> AND <low hemoglobin level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** outpatients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** low hemoglobin level\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `HGB` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`HGB` < 10\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (outpatients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (low hemoglobin level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`HGB` < 10\n\n* **Main Question (IDs and sex of outpatients with low hemoglobin):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`, `T1`.`SEX` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Admission` = '-' AND `T2`.`HGB` < 10\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
