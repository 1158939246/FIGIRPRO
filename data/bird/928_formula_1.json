Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (first position):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`position` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Canadian Grand Prix):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Canadian Grand Prix'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (year 2007):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`year` = 2007\n\n* **Main Question (driver reference name):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`driverRef` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T3`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`position` = 1 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Canadian Grand Prix' AND `T2`.`year` = 2007\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
