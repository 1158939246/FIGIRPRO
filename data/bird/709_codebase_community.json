This requires joining the `comments` table with the `posts` table based on the `PostId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE <comments with score 0> AND <view count lower than 5>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** comments with score 0\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `comments` table using the `Score` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Score` = 0\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** view count lower than 5\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `posts` table using the `ViewCount` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`ViewCount` < 5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (comments with score 0):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Score` = 0\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (view count lower than 5):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`ViewCount` < 5\n\n* **Main Question (count of posts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`Id`) FROM `comments` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `posts` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`PostId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Score` = 0 AND `T2`.`ViewCount` < 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
