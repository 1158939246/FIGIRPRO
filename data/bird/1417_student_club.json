Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List out the type of events which have remaining budget more than 30 USD.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `type` of events from the `event` table where the associated budget's `remaining` amount is greater than 30. This requires a join between the `event` and `budget` tables based on the `event_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`type` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE <remaining budget > 30>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** remaining budget > 30\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `budget` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`remaining` > 30\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (remaining budget > 30):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`remaining` > 30\n\n* **Main Question (type of events):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`type` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` WHERE `T2`.`remaining` > 30\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
