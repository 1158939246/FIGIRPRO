Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the sets of cards that have an Italian translation, how many of them have a base set number of under 100?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the sets that meet two criteria: they have an Italian translation and their `baseSetSize` is less than 100. This requires joining the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table to filter by language and translation.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE <Italian translation> AND <base set number under 100>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Italian translation\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `set_translations` table for rows where `language` is 'Italian' and `translation` is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** base set number under 100\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `sets` table for rows where `baseSetSize` is less than 100.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`baseSetSize` < 100\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Italian translation):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (base set number under 100):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`baseSetSize` < 100\n\n* **Main Question (count of sets):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T2`.`language` = 'Italian' AND `T2`.`translation` IS NOT NULL AND `T1`.`baseSetSize` < 100\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
