This requires joining the three tables: `cards`, `legalities`, and `foreign_data`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`uuid`, `T3`.`language` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T3`.`uuid` WHERE <legacy card> \n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** legacy card\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `legalities` table using the `format` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`format` = 'legacy'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (legacy card):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`format` = 'legacy'\n\n* **Main Question (uuid and foreign language):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`uuid`, `T3`.`language` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` INNER JOIN `foreign_data` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T3`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`format` = 'legacy'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
