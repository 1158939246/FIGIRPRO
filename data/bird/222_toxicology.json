Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the difference between the number of molecules that are carcinogenic and those that are not?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of carcinogenic molecules (where `label` is '+') and the number of non-carcinogenic molecules (where `label` is '-'). The difference will be calculated by subtracting the count of non-carcinogenic molecules from the count of carcinogenic molecules.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '+' THEN 1 END) - COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '-' THEN 1 END)) AS difference FROM `molecule`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of carcinogenic molecules\n        * **Analysis:** This can be done using a conditional count on the `label` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '+' THEN 1 END)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of non-carcinogenic molecules\n        * **Analysis:** Similarly, we can count the non-carcinogenic molecules using a conditional count.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '-' THEN 1 END)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of carcinogenic molecules):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '+' THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of non-carcinogenic molecules):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '-' THEN 1 END)\n\n* **Main Question (difference):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '+' THEN 1 END) - COUNT(CASE WHEN `label` = '-' THEN 1 END)) AS difference FROM `molecule`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using conditional aggregation to count the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic molecules in a single query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
