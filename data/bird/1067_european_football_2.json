Please list their short names.  \n**Evidence**: build up play passing refers to buildUpPlayPassing; buildUpPlayPassing > 70; short names refers to team_short_name;\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which teams have build up play passing more than 70? Please list their short names.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `team_short_name` from the `Team` table where the corresponding `buildUpPlayPassing` in the `Team_Attributes` table is greater than 70. This requires a join between the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE <buildUpPlayPassing > 70>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** buildUpPlayPassing > 70\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Team_Attributes` table using the `buildUpPlayPassing` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` > 70\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (buildUpPlayPassing > 70):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` > 70\n\n* **Main Question (teams with build up play passing > 70):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` > 70\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
