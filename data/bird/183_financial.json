The `account` table contains the `date` of account creation, and the `district` table contains the district name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`account_id`) FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <accounts opened after 1996> AND <district is Beroun>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** accounts opened after 1996\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `account` table based on the `date` column. We will check if the date is greater than '1996-12-31'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`date` > '1996-12-31'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** district is Beroun\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `district` table to find the row where the district name is 'Beroun'. We will use the `A2` column from the `district` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`A2` = 'Beroun'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (accounts opened after 1996):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`date` > '1996-12-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (district is Beroun):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`A2` = 'Beroun'\n\n* **Main Question (count of accounts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`account_id`) FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T1`.`date` > '1996-12-31' AND `T2`.`A2` = 'Beroun'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
