Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all races in 2017 and the hosting country order by date of the event.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the race details from the `races` table for the year 2017 and join it with the `circuits` table to get the hosting country. The results should be ordered by the date of the event.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`date`, `T2`.`country` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE <year is 2017> ORDER BY `T1`.`date`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** year is 2017\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `year` column in the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`year` = 2017\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year is 2017):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`year` = 2017\n\n* **Main Question (list of races and hosting country):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T1`.`date`, `T2`.`country` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE `T1`.`year` = 2017 ORDER BY `T1`.`date`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause is applied to the date of the event.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
