This requires joining the `card` and `account` tables based on the `disp_id` in the `card` table and the `account_id` in the `disp` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`account_id` FROM `card` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`disp_id` = `T2`.`disp_id` WHERE <card type is gold>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** card type is gold\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `card` table using the `type` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`type` = 'gold'\n\n**2.
