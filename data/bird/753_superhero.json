Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the superheroes with height from 170 to 190, list the names of the superheroes with no eye color.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter superheroes based on their height and eye color. The `superhero` table contains the height and references the `colour` table for eye color. We will join these tables to apply the necessary filters.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <height from 170 to 190> AND <no eye color>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** height from 170 to 190\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `height_cm` column in the `superhero` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` BETWEEN 170 AND 190\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** no eye color\n        * **Analysis:** This requires checking if the `colour` associated with the superhero's eye color is 'No Colour'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'No Colour'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (height from 170 to 190):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` BETWEEN 170 AND 190\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (no eye color):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`colour` = 'No Colour'\n\n* **Main Question (names of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`height_cm` BETWEEN 170 AND 190 AND `T2`.`colour` = 'No Colour'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `colour` tables based on the eye color ID, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
