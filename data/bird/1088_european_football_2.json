Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the names of the players whose volley score and dribbling score are over 70.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select player names from the `Player` table where their volley score and dribbling score from the `Player_Attributes` table are both greater than 70. This requires joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <volley score > 70> AND <dribbling score > 70>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** volley score > 70\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player_Attributes` table using the `volleys` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`volleys` > 70\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** dribbling score > 70\n        * **Analysis:** Similar to sub-question 1, this filter will be applied to the `dribbling` column in the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`dribbling` > 70\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (volley score > 70):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`volleys` > 70\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (dribbling score > 70):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`dribbling` > 70\n\n* **Main Question (player names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`volleys` > 70 AND `T2`.`dribbling` > 70\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
