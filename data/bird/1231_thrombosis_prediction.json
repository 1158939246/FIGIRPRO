Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For patient born between 1936-1956, how many male patients have creatinine phosphokinase beyond the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct male patients who were born in the specified range and have a CPK value greater than or equal to 250. This involves filtering based on the `Birthday`, `SEX`, and `CPK` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <born between 1936-1956> AND <male patients> AND <CPK beyond normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born between 1936-1956\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `Birthday` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`Birthday`) BETWEEN '1936' AND '1956'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** CPK beyond normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `CPK` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`CPK` >= 250\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born between 1936-1956):**\n    * **SQL:** YEAR(`T1`.`Birthday`) BETWEEN '1936' AND '1956'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (CPK beyond normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`CPK` >= 250\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T2`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE YEAR(`T1`.`Birthday`) BETWEEN '1936' AND '1956' AND `T1`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `T2`.`CPK` >= 250\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. \n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
