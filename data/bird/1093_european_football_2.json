Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average overall rating of the players born before the year 1986?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires calculating the average of the `overall_rating` column from the `Player_Attributes` table for players whose `birthday` is before 1986. We will use the `SUM()` and `COUNT()` functions to compute the average.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(`overall_rating`), COUNT(`id`)) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE <born before 1986>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born before 1986\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `birthday` column in the `Player` table using the `STRFTIME()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`birthday`) < '1986'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born before 1986):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`birthday`) < '1986'\n\n* **Main Question (average overall rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(`T1`.`overall_rating`), COUNT(`T1`.`id`)) FROM `Player_Attributes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`birthday`) < '1986'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player_Attributes` and `Player` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
