Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List down the bond type for molecules from molecule id TR000 to TR050.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the bond types for molecules with IDs ranging from TR000 to TR050. This involves filtering the `bond` table based on the `molecule_id` and selecting the `bond_type`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `bond_type` FROM `bond` WHERE <molecule_id between TR000 and TR050>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** molecule_id between TR000 and TR050\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter the `molecule_id` column in the `bond` table to include only those IDs that fall within the specified range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `molecule_id` BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR050'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (molecule_id between TR000 and TR050):**\n    * **SQL:** `molecule_id` BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR050'\n\n* **Main Question (bond types):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `bond_type` FROM `bond` WHERE `molecule_id` BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR050'\n\n**3.
