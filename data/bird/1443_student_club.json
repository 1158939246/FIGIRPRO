Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Give the event ID, location, and status of events conducted from November 2019 to March 2020.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the `event_id`, `location`, and `status` from the `event` table. We need to filter the events based on the date range provided in the evidence.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `event_id`, `location`, `status` FROM `event` WHERE <events conducted between November 2019 and March 2020>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** events conducted between November 2019 and March 2020\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `event_date` column in the `event` table using the `BETWEEN` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `event_date` BETWEEN '2019-11-01' AND '2020-03-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (events conducted between November 2019 and March 2020):**\n    * **SQL:** `event_date` BETWEEN '2019-11-01' AND '2020-03-31'\n\n* **Main Question (event ID, location, and status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `event_id`, `location`, `status` FROM `event` WHERE `event_date` BETWEEN '2019-11-01' AND '2020-03-31'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly selects the required columns and applies the necessary filter on the `event_date`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
