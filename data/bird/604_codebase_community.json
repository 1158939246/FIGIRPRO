Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average of the up votes and the average user age for users creating more than 10 posts?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate two averages: one for up votes and one for user age. Both calculations will be based on users who have created more than 10 posts. This requires aggregating data from the `users` and `posts` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT <average up votes>, <average user age> FROM `users` AS `U` INNER JOIN (SELECT `OwnerUserId`, COUNT(*) AS `PostCount` FROM `posts` GROUP BY `OwnerUserId` HAVING COUNT(*) > 10) AS `P` ON `U`.`Id` = `P`.`OwnerUserId`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** average of the up votes\n        * **Analysis:** This requires summing the `UpVotes` and dividing by the count of users who meet the criteria.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`U`.`UpVotes`) / COUNT(`U`.`Id`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** average user age\n        * **Analysis:** This requires summing the `Age` and dividing by the count of users who meet the criteria.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SUM(`U`.`Age`) / COUNT(`U`.`Id`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average of the up votes):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`U`.`UpVotes`) / COUNT(`U`.`Id`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (average user age):**\n    * **SQL:** SUM(`U`.`Age`) / COUNT(`U`.`Id`)\n\n* **Main Question (combined averages):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`U`.`UpVotes`) / COUNT(`U`.`Id`) AS `AverageUpVotes`, SUM(`U`.`Age`) / COUNT(`U`.`Id`) AS `AverageAge` FROM `users` AS `U` INNER JOIN (SELECT `OwnerUserId`, COUNT(*) AS `PostCount` FROM `posts` GROUP BY `OwnerUserId` HAVING COUNT(*) > 10) AS `P` ON `U`.`Id` = `P`.`OwnerUserId`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to filter users based on their post count and calculating the averages in a single query.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
