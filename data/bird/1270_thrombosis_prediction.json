Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients who has a normal anti-scl70, how many of them are female and does not have any symptom?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the distinct patients who meet the criteria of having a normal anti-scl70, being female, and not having any symptoms. This involves filtering based on the `SC170`, `SEX`, and `Symptoms` columns across the `Patient` and `Examination` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal anti-scl70> AND <female> AND <no symptoms>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal anti-scl70\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SC170` column in the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`SC170` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** female\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** no symptoms\n        * **Analysis:** This filter checks if the `Symptoms` column in the `Examination` table is NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Symptoms` IS NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal anti-scl70):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`SC170` IN ('negative', '0')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (female):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (no symptoms):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Symptoms` IS NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of distinct patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`SC170` IN ('negative', '0') AND `T1`.`SEX` = 'F' AND `T2`.`Symptoms` IS NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The use of `DISTINCT` ensures we only count unique patients.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
