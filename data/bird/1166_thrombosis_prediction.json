Identify their diagnosis.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the youngest patient based on their birthday and then retrieve their symptoms and diagnosis. The `Patient` table contains the `Birthday` and `Diagnosis`, while the `Examination` table contains the `Symptoms`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Symptoms`, `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <youngest patient> AND <symptoms are not NULL>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** youngest patient\n        * **Analysis:** To find the youngest patient, we need to order the patients by their `Birthday` in descending order and limit the result to 1.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Birthday` = (SELECT MAX(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** symptoms are not NULL\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Examination` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (youngest patient):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Birthday` = (SELECT MAX(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (symptoms are not NULL):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (symptoms and diagnosis):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Symptoms`, `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`Birthday` = (SELECT MAX(`Birthday`) FROM `Patient`) AND `T1`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Examination` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
