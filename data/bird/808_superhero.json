Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find the race of the superhero who weighs 108kg and is 188cm tall.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `race` of a superhero based on two conditions: their weight and height. The relevant tables are `superhero` and `race`, which we will join based on the `race_id`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <weight condition> AND <height condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** weight condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superhero` table using the `weight_kg` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` = 108\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** height condition\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `superhero` table using the `height_cm` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` = 188\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (weight condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`weight_kg` = 108\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (height condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`height_cm` = 188\n\n* **Main Question (race of the superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`weight_kg` = 108 AND `T1`.`height_cm` = 188\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
