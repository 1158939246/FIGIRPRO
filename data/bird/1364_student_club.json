We will first locate Amy Firth in the `member` table and then join with the `zip_code` table to get the relevant hometown information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `city`, `county`, `state` FROM `zip_code` WHERE `zip` = (SELECT `zip` FROM `member` WHERE `first_name` = 'Amy' AND `last_name` = 'Firth')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find Amy Firth's zip code\n        * **Analysis:** This requires a simple query to filter the `member` table for Amy Firth.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `zip` FROM `member` WHERE `first_name` = 'Amy' AND `last_name` = 'Firth'\n\n**2.
