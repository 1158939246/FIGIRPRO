We will use the `COUNT()` function on the `superhero` table, filtering by the `race` column from the `race` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <race is Vampire>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race is Vampire\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `race` table using the `race` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Vampire'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race is Vampire):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Vampire'\n\n* **Main Question (count of vampire superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`race` = 'Vampire'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
