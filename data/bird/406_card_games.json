Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Lists by ID all Creature-type cards with legal status.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `id` of cards that are of type 'Creature' and have a legal status. This requires filtering based on the `types` column in the `cards` table and the `status` column in the `legalities` table. We will need to join these two tables on the `uuid` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <status is legal> AND <type is Creature>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** status is legal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `legalities` table using the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'legal'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** type is Creature\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `types` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`types` LIKE 'Creature'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (status is legal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`status` = 'legal'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (type is Creature):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`types` LIKE 'Creature'\n\n* **Main Question (list of IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`id` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `legalities` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`status` = 'legal' AND `T1`.`types` LIKE 'Creature'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
