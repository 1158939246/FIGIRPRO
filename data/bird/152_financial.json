Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average number of crimes committed in 1995 in regions where the number exceeds 4000 and the region has accounts that are opened starting from the year 1997?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average of `A15` (number of crimes committed in 1995) for regions that meet two conditions: the number of crimes exceeds 4000 and there are accounts opened from 1997 onwards. This requires joining the `district` and `account` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`A15`) FROM `district` WHERE <number of crimes exceeds 4000> AND <region has accounts opened from 1997>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** number of crimes exceeds 4000\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `A15` column in the `district` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `A15` > 4000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** region has accounts opened from 1997\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `district` table with the `account` table on `district_id` and filter for accounts where the `date` is from 1997 onwards. \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `account` WHERE `date` >= '1997-01-01')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (number of crimes exceeds 4000):**\n    * **SQL:** `A15` > 4000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (region has accounts opened from 1997):**\n    * **SQL:** `district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `account` WHERE `date` >= '1997-01-01')\n\n* **Main Question (average number of crimes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`A15`) FROM `district` WHERE `A15` > 4000 AND `district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `account` WHERE `date` >= '1997-01-01')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to filter the districts based on the conditions provided.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
