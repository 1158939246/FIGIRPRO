Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients with a normal Rhuematoid Factor has a positive measure of degree of coagulation?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count distinct patients who meet two criteria: having a normal Rhuematoid Factor and a positive measure of degree of coagulation. The relevant columns are `RA` from the `Laboratory` table and `KCT` from the `Examination` table. We will need to join the `Laboratory` and `Examination` tables on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key in both tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal Rhuematoid Factor> AND <positive measure of degree of coagulation>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal Rhuematoid Factor  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `RA` column in the `Laboratory` table.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
