We need to filter these cards based on the condition that they have a text box, indicated by `isTextless = 0`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE <cards have a text box>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** cards have a text box\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `isTextless` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `isTextless` = 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (cards have a text box):**\n    * **SQL:** `isTextless` = 0\n\n* **Main Question (names of cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `cards` WHERE `isTextless` = 0\n\n**3.

It directly selects the `name` from the `cards` table where the condition for having a text box is met.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
