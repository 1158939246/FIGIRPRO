Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list the top three patients' birthdays with the highest glutamic pyruvic transaminase in the normal range.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `Birthday` of patients who have a `GPT` value below 60. We will also need to order the results by `GPT` in descending order and limit the results to the top three.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GPT` < 60 ORDER BY `T2`.`GPT` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for normal range of GPT\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table where we select rows with `GPT` values less than 60.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GPT` < 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal range for GPT):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GPT` < 60\n\n* **Main Question (top three patients' birthdays):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GPT` < 60 ORDER BY `T2`.`GPT` DESC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures we get the highest `GPT` values.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
