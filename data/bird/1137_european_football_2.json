The relevant columns are `strength` and `stamina` from the `Player_Attributes` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(*) WHERE <strength and stamina > 80> / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage FROM `Player_Attributes`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** strength and stamina > 80\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Player_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `strength` > 80 AND `stamina` > 80\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (strength and stamina > 80):**\n    * **SQL:** `strength` > 80 AND `stamina` > 80\n\n* **Main Question (percentage of players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Player_Attributes)) AS percentage FROM Player_Attributes WHERE `strength` > 80 AND `stamina` > 80\n\n**3.
