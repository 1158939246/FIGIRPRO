Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the city location of the high school level school with Lunch Provision 2 whose lowest grade is 9 and the highest grade is 12 in the county of Merced?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the city location of schools that meet several criteria: they must be high schools (EILCode = 'HS'), have a Lunch Provision status of 'Lunch Provision 2', have a lowest grade of 9, a highest grade of 12, and be located in the county of Merced.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `City` FROM `schools` WHERE <criteria for high school> AND <criteria for Lunch Provision> AND <criteria for lowest grade> AND <criteria for highest grade> AND <criteria for county>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** criteria for high school\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `EILCode` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `EILCode` = 'HS'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** criteria for Lunch Provision\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will check the `NSLP Provision Status` column for 'Lunch Provision 2'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `NSLP Provision Status` = 'Lunch Provision 2'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** criteria for lowest grade\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will check the `Low Grade` column for '9'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Low Grade` = '9'\n\n    * **Sub-question 4:** criteria for highest grade\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will check the `High Grade` column for '12'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `High Grade` = '12'\n\n    * **Sub-question 5:** criteria for county\n        * **Analysis:** This filter will check the `County` column for 'Merced'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `County` = 'Merced'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (criteria for high school):**\n    * **SQL:** `EILCode` = 'HS'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (criteria for Lunch Provision):**\n    * **SQL:** `NSLP Provision Status` = 'Lunch Provision 2'\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (criteria for lowest grade):**\n    * **SQL:** `Low Grade` = '9'\n\n* **Sub-question 4 (criteria for highest grade):**\n    * **SQL:** `High Grade` = '12'\n\n* **Sub-question 5 (criteria for county):**\n    * **SQL:** `County` = 'Merced'\n\n* **Main Question (city location):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `City` FROM `schools` WHERE `EILCode` = 'HS' AND `NSLP Provision Status` = 'Lunch Provision 2' AND `Low Grade` = '9' AND `High Grade` = '12' AND `County` = 'Merced'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It uses a single `SELECT` statement with multiple `AND` conditions to filter the results based on the specified criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
