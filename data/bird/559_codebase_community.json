This requires aggregating the votes by `CreationDate` and then finding the maximum count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `CreationDate` FROM `votes` GROUP BY `CreationDate` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) = <max count of votes>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** max count of votes\n        * **Analysis:** We need to determine the maximum count of votes across all `CreationDate` entries.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(vote_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(`Id`) AS vote_count FROM `votes` GROUP BY `CreationDate`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (max count of votes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(vote_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(`Id`) AS vote_count FROM `votes` GROUP BY `CreationDate`)\n\n* **Main Question (creation date of maximum votes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `CreationDate` FROM `votes` GROUP BY `CreationDate` HAVING COUNT(`Id`) = (SELECT MAX(vote_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(`Id`) AS vote_count FROM `votes` GROUP BY `CreationDate`))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to avoid redundancy. However, since we are already using a subquery to find the maximum count, the query is efficient as is.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
