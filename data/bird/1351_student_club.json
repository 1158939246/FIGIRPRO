This requires joining the `member` table with the `major` table based on the `link_to_major` foreign key.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`major_name` FROM `member` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_major` = `T2`.`major_id` WHERE <member's full name is Brent Thomason>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** member's full name is Brent Thomason\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `member` table for the specific first and last names.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`first_name` = 'Brent' AND `T1`.`last_name` = 'Thomason'\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `member` and `major` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
