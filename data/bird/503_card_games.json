This requires joining the `cards` table with the `sets` table through the `setCode` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`type` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE <card name is Samite Pilgrim>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** card name is Samite Pilgrim  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Samite Pilgrim'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (card name is Samite Pilgrim):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Samite Pilgrim'\n\n* **Main Question (expansion type):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`type` FROM `cards` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T1`.`name` = 'Samite Pilgrim'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
