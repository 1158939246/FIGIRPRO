Indicate its short name only.  \n**Evidence**: chance creation passing class refers to chanceCreationPassingClass; chanceCreationPassingClass = 'Risky'; short name refers to team_short_name.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the football teams that has a chance creation passing class of Risky. Indicate its short name only.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `team_short_name` from the `Team` table where the associated `chanceCreationPassingClass` in the `Team_Attributes` table is 'Risky'. This requires a join between the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Risky'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** chance creation passing class of Risky\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `chanceCreationPassingClass` column in the `Team_Attributes` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Risky'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (chance creation passing class of Risky):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Risky'\n\n* **Main Question (list of teams):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_short_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`chanceCreationPassingClass` = 'Risky'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
