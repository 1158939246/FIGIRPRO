Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the bond type for atoms with element Tin?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the bond types associated with atoms that have the element 'sn'. This requires joining the `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables to get the relevant bond types.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T4`.`bond_type` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`bond_id` = `T3`.`bond_id` WHERE `T1`.`element` = 'sn'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for atoms with element Tin  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `atom` table using the `element` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`element` = 'sn'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (atoms with element Tin):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`element` = 'sn'\n\n* **Main Question (bond types for Tin atoms):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T4`.`bond_type` FROM `atom` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `connected` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`atom_id` = `T2`.`atom_id` INNER JOIN `bond` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`bond_id` = `T3`.`bond_id` WHERE `T1`.`element` = 'sn'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
