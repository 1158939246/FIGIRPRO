Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the long name of teams with above-average build-up play passing in 2012.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `team_long_name` from the `Team` table where the `buildUpPlayPassing` is greater than the average for the year 2012. This requires calculating the average `buildUpPlayPassing` for that year.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_long_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` > (SELECT AVG(`T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing`) FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` WHERE strftime('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '2012' AND `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` IS NOT NULL)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate the average build-up play passing for 2012.\n        * **Analysis:** This involves selecting the average of `buildUpPlayPassing` from the `Team_Attributes` table where the year is 2012 and the value is not NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing`) FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` WHERE strftime('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '2012' AND `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average build-up play passing for 2012):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing`) FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` WHERE strftime('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '2012' AND `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (long name of teams with above-average build-up play passing):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`team_long_name` FROM `Team` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` > (SELECT AVG(`T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing`) FROM `Team_Attributes` AS `T2` WHERE strftime('%Y', `T2`.`date`) = '2012' AND `T2`.`buildUpPlayPassing` IS NOT NULL)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Team` and `Team_Attributes` tables and a subquery to calculate the average `buildUpPlayPassing` for the year 2012.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
