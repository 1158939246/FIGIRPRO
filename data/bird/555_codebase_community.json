Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average score of the posts owned by the user csgillespie?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average score of posts, which is represented by the `Score` column in the `posts` table. To do this, we first need to identify the user ID associated with the display name \"csgillespie\" from the `users` table, and then filter the posts based on that user ID.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`Score`) FROM `posts` AS `T1` WHERE <posts owned by user csgillespie>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** posts owned by user csgillespie  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `posts` table with the `users` table to filter posts based on the user display name. The relevant columns are `OwnerUserId` in the `posts` table and `Id` in the `users` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = (SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `users` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`DisplayName` = 'csgillespie')\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (posts owned by user csgillespie):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = (SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `users` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`DisplayName` = 'csgillespie')\n\n* **Main Question (average score of posts):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`Score`) FROM `posts` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = (SELECT `T2`.`Id` FROM `users` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`DisplayName` = 'csgillespie')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the user ID based on the display name and then calculating the average score of the posts owned by that user.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
