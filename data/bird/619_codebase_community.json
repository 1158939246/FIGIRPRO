This requires joining the `badges` and `users` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` AS `U` INNER JOIN `badges` AS `B` ON `U`.`Id` = `B`.`UserId` WHERE <badge is Supporter> AND <age is between 19 and 65>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** badge is Supporter\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `badges` table using the `Name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `B`.`Name` = 'Supporter'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age is between 19 and 65\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `users` table using the `Age` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `U`.`Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (badge is Supporter):**\n    * **SQL:** `B`.`Name` = 'Supporter'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age is between 19 and 65):**\n    * **SQL:** `U`.`Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n* **Main Question (count of adults with Supporter badge):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users` AS `U` INNER JOIN `badges` AS `B` ON `U`.`Id` = `B`.`UserId` WHERE `B`.`Name` = 'Supporter' AND `U`.`Age` BETWEEN 19 AND 65\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
