Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Provide the IDs and age of the client with high level credit card, which is eligible for loans.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `client_id` and calculate the age of clients who have a high-level credit card and are eligible for loans. The age can be calculated from the `birth_date` column in the `client` table. We will need to join the `client`, `disp`, and `card` tables to filter based on the conditions provided.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id`, STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`birth_date`) AS age FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` INNER JOIN `card` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`account_id` = `T3`.`disp_id` WHERE <high level credit card> AND <eligible for loans>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** high level credit card\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters the `card` table for entries where the `type` is 'gold'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`type` = 'gold'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** eligible for loans\n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters the `disp` table for entries where the `type` is 'OWNER'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (high level credit card):**\n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`type` = 'gold'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (eligible for loans):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n* **Main Question (IDs and age of clients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id`, STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`birth_date`) AS age FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` INNER JOIN `card` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`account_id` = `T3`.`disp_id` WHERE `T3`.`type` = 'gold' AND `T2`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
