Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients with a normal Ig A level came to the hospital after 1990/1/1?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who meet two criteria: they have a normal Ig A level and their `First Date` is after January 1, 1990. The `Laboratory` table contains the Ig A levels, and the `Patient` table contains the `First Date`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal Ig A level> AND <came to the hospital after 1990/1/1>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal Ig A level  \n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `Laboratory` table for Ig A levels that are greater than 80 and less than 500.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`IGA` > 80 AND `T2`.`IGA` < 500\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** came to the hospital after 1990/1/1  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Patient` table based on the `First Date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`First Date`) >= '1990'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal Ig A level):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`IGA` > 80 AND `T2`.`IGA` < 500\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (came to the hospital after 1990/1/1):**  \n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`First Date`) >= '1990'\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`IGA` > 80 AND `T2`.`IGA` < 500 AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T1`.`First Date`) >= '1990'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
