Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the total number of schools whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500 whose mailing city is Lakeport? \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of schools that meet two criteria: their total SAT scores (computed from three average scores) must be greater than or equal to 1500, and their mailing city must be 'Lakeport'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE <total SAT scores >= 1500> AND <mailing city is Lakeport>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** total SAT scores >= 1500\n        * **Analysis:** The total SAT score can be calculated as `AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite`. We need to filter for schools where this sum is greater than or equal to 1500.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`AvgScrRead` + `T2`.`AvgScrMath` + `T2`.`AvgScrWrite` >= 1500\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** mailing city is Lakeport\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `schools` table using the `MailCity` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`MailCity` = 'Lakeport'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total SAT scores >= 1500):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`AvgScrRead` + `T2`.`AvgScrMath` + `T2`.`AvgScrWrite` >= 1500\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (mailing city is Lakeport):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`MailCity` = 'Lakeport'\n\n* **Main Question (count of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE `T2`.`AvgScrRead` + `T2`.`AvgScrMath` + `T2`.`AvgScrWrite` >= 1500 AND `T1`.`MailCity` = 'Lakeport'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `schools` and `satscores` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
