Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all patients with their sex and date of birthday, whose AST glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) index is within normal range for laboratory examination in 1994.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `SEX` and `Birthday` from the `Patient` table, while filtering based on the `GOT` index from the `Laboratory` table. We will join these two tables on the `ID` column. The filtering conditions are that `GOT` must be less than 60 and the year of the `Date` must be 1994.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <GOT index is within normal range> AND <examination in 1994>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** GOT index is within normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `GOT` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GOT` < 60\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** examination in 1994\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `Date` column to ensure it falls within the year 1994.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Date`) = '1994'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (GOT index is within normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GOT` < 60\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (examination in 1994):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Date`) = '1994'\n\n* **Main Question (patients with sex and birthday):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`SEX`, `T1`.`Birthday` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GOT` < 60 AND STRFTIME('%Y', `T2`.`Date`) = '1994'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
