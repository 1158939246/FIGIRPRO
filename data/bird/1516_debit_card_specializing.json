Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many transactions were paid in CZK in the morning of 2012/8/26?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the transactions that meet two criteria: they were paid in CZK and occurred in the morning of the specified date. The `transactions_1k` table contains the transaction details, and we will filter based on the `Price` and `Date` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE <transactions in CZK> AND <transactions in the morning of 2012-08-26>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** transactions in CZK  \n        * **Analysis:** To determine if a transaction was paid in CZK, we need to join the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table on `CustomerID` and filter by `Currency`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `CustomerID` IN (SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `customers` WHERE `Currency` = 'CZK')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** transactions in the morning of 2012-08-26  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `transactions_1k` table based on the `Date` and `Time` columns. We need to ensure that the date is '2012-08-26' and the time is before '13:00:00'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Date` = '2012-08-26' AND `Time` < '13:00:00'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (transactions in CZK):**  \n    * **SQL:** `CustomerID` IN (SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `customers` WHERE `Currency` = 'CZK')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (transactions in the morning of 2012-08-26):**  \n    * **SQL:** `Date` = '2012-08-26' AND `Time` < '13:00:00'\n\n* **Main Question (count of transactions):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `CustomerID` IN (SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `customers` WHERE `Currency` = 'CZK') AND `Date` = '2012-08-26' AND `Time` < '13:00:00'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to filter transactions based on the currency and applying the necessary date and time filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
