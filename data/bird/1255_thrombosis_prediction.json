This requires filtering the `Examination` table for patients with abnormal Ig M levels and then counting the occurrences of each diagnosis.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Diagnosis`, COUNT(`Diagnosis`) FROM `Examination` WHERE <abnormal Ig M level> GROUP BY `Diagnosis` ORDER BY COUNT(`Diagnosis`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** abnormal Ig M level\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `Laboratory` table where we check for `IGM <= 40 OR IGM >= 400`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `IGM <= 40 OR IGM >= 400`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (abnormal Ig M level):**\n    * **SQL:** `IGM <= 40 OR IGM >= 400`\n\n* **Main Question (most common disease):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis`, COUNT(`T2`.`Diagnosis`) FROM `Examination` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`ID` = `T1`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`IGM` <= 40 OR `T1`.`IGM` >= 400 GROUP BY `T2`.`Diagnosis` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`Diagnosis`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, filtering for abnormal Ig M levels, and counting the diagnoses.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
