The relevant columns are `AvgScrMath` from the `satscores` table and `Charter Funding Type` from the `schools` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE <average score in Math > 560> AND <directly charter-funded>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** average score in Math > 560\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `AvgScrMath` column in the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`AvgScrMath` > 560\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** directly charter-funded\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Charter Funding Type` column in the `schools` table to include only those schools that are directly charter-funded.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average score in Math > 560):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`AvgScrMath` > 560\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (directly charter-funded):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'\n\n* **Main Question (count of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `schools` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `satscores` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CDSCode` = `T2`.`cds` WHERE `T2`.`AvgScrMath` > 560 AND `T1`.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'\n\n**3.
