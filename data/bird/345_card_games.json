Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For artifact type of cards that do not have multiple faces on the same card, state its legalities status for vintage play format.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the legalities status for cards that are of type 'Artifact', do not have multiple faces (i.e., `side` is NULL), and are legal for the vintage format. This requires joining the `cards` and `legalities` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`status` FROM `legalities` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <artifact type> AND <no multiple faces> AND <vintage format>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** artifact type\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `types` column in the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`types` = 'Artifact'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** no multiple faces\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `side` column in the `cards` table is NULL.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`side` IS NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** vintage format\n        * **Analysis:** This condition checks if the `format` column in the `legalities` table is 'vintage'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`format` = 'vintage'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (artifact type):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`types` = 'Artifact'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (no multiple faces):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`side` IS NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (vintage format):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`format` = 'vintage'\n\n* **Main Question (legalities status):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`status` FROM `legalities` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`types` = 'Artifact' AND `T2`.`side` IS NULL AND `T1`.`format` = 'vintage'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
