We will filter for the `name` of the circuit being 'Silverstone Circuit' and then select the distinct years from the `races` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `year` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Silverstone Circuit'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (years that Silverstone Circuit was used):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T1`.`year` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Silverstone Circuit'\n\n**3.
