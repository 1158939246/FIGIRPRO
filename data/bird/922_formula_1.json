Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What time did the 2010's Formula 1 race take place on the Abu Dhabi Circuit?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter races based on the year (2010's) and the circuit name (Abu Dhabi Circuit). The relevant columns are `year` from the `races` table and `name` from the `circuits` table. We will join the `races` and `circuits` tables to get the race time.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`time` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE <year is in the 2010's> AND <circuit name is Abu Dhabi Circuit>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** year is in the 2010's\n        * **Analysis:** This can be checked using the `year` column in the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** circuit name is Abu Dhabi Circuit\n        * **Analysis:** This can be checked using the `name` column in the `circuits` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Abu Dhabi Circuit'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year is in the 2010's):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (circuit name is Abu Dhabi Circuit):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Abu Dhabi Circuit'\n\n* **Main Question (race time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`time` FROM `races` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `circuits` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`circuitId` = `T2`.`circuitId` WHERE `T1`.`year` BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019 AND `T2`.`name` = 'Abu Dhabi Circuit'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
