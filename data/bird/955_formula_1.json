Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the average time in seconds of champion for each year, before year 1975?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average finishing time of the champions for each year before 1975. The finishing time is represented in the `time` column of the `results` table. We will need to filter the results to include only those where the `position` indicates the champion (position = 1) and where the year is less than 1975.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT year, AVG(time_in_seconds) FROM results AS R INNER JOIN races AS R2 ON R.raceId = R2.raceId WHERE <champion's finished time> AND <before year 1975> GROUP BY year\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** champion's finished time\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the results to include only those where the position is 1 (indicating the champion).\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** R.position = 1 AND R.time IS NOT NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** before year 1975\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `races` table based on the year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** R2.year < 1975\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Convert finishing time to seconds\n        * **Analysis:** We need to convert the `time` format 'HH:MM:SS.mmm' into seconds for averaging. This can be done using string manipulation functions.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 3600 + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 4, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60 + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 7, 2) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 10, 3) AS INTEGER) / 1000)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (champion's finished time):**\n    * **SQL:** R.position = 1 AND R.time IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (before year 1975):**\n    * **SQL:** R2.year < 1975\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (convert finishing time to seconds):**\n    * **SQL:** (CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 3600 + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 4, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60 + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 7, 2) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 10, 3) AS INTEGER) / 1000)\n\n* **Main Question (average time in seconds):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT R2.year, AVG(CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 3600 + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 4, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60 + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 7, 2) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTR(R.time, 10, 3) AS INTEGER) / 1000) AS average_time_in_seconds FROM results AS R INNER JOIN races AS R2 ON R.raceId = R2.raceId WHERE R.position = 1 AND R.time IS NOT NULL AND R2.year < 1975 GROUP BY R2.year\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `results` and `races` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The conversion of time to seconds is done inline for the average calculation.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
