Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many cards are oversized, reprinted, and printed for promotions?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of cards that meet all three conditions: oversized, reprinted, and printed for promotions. All these conditions can be applied directly to the `cards` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `cards` WHERE <oversized> AND <reprinted> AND <printed for promotions>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** oversized\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `isOversized` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `isOversized` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** reprinted\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `isReprint` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `isReprint` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** printed for promotions\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `isPromo` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `isPromo` = 1\n\n**2.
