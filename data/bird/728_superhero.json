Additionally, we will filter the superheroes based on the publisher, which is found in the `publisher` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`colour`, COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T3`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics' GROUP BY `T2`.`colour` ORDER BY COUNT(`T1`.`id`) DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count superheroes by eye color\n        * **Analysis:** This is part of the main query where we will count the number of superheroes for each eye color.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T1`.`id`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter by publisher\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the superheroes to only include those from Marvel Comics.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T3`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Join superhero with color and publisher\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `superhero` table with the `colour` table to get the eye color names and with the `publisher` table to filter by publisher.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1` INNER JOIN `colour` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`eye_colour_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T3`.`id`\n\n**2.
