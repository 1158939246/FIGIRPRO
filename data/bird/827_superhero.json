This requires filtering based on the `race` and `publisher_name`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`height_cm`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE <non-human superhero> AND <Dark Horse Comics>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** non-human superhero  \n        * **Analysis:** This condition filters out superheroes whose race is 'Human'.

Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (non-human superhero):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`race` <> 'Human'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Dark Horse Comics):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T3`.`publisher_name` = 'Dark Horse Comics'\n\n* **Main Question (average height):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`height_cm`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T3`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`race` <> 'Human' AND `T3`.`publisher_name` = 'Dark Horse Comics'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applied the filtering conditions directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
