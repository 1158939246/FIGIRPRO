We will filter based on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table and the `ALP` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <patients followed at outpatient clinic> AND <normal level of alkaliphophatase>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** patients followed at outpatient clinic\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Admission` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`Admission` = '-'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal level of alkaliphophatase\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `ALP` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`ALP` < 300\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
