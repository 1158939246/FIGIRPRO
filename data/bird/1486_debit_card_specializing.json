If so, how many more?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the total number of SMEs that pay using each currency (CZK and EUR) and then find the difference. The `customers` table contains the `Segment` and `Currency` columns, which we will use to filter for SMEs and their respective currencies.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (Total SMEs paying in CZK - Total SMEs paying in EUR) AS Difference FROM <sub-queries>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Total SMEs paying in CZK\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of SMEs that use the currency CZK. This involves filtering the `customers` table for SMEs and checking the `Currency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customers` WHERE `Segment` = 'SME' AND `Currency` = 'CZK'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Total SMEs paying in EUR\n        * **Analysis:** Similarly, we need to count the number of SMEs that use the currency EUR.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customers` WHERE `Segment` = 'SME' AND `Currency` = 'EUR'\n\n**2.
