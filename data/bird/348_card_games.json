Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Describe the information about rulings for card named 'Sublime Epiphany' with number 74s.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `text` from the `rulings` table for the card that matches the name 'Sublime Epiphany' and the number '74s'. This requires joining the `cards` table with the `rulings` table based on the `uuid`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`text` FROM `rulings` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <card name is 'Sublime Epiphany'> AND <card number is '74s'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** card name is 'Sublime Epiphany'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Sublime Epiphany'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** card number is '74s'\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `cards` table using the `number` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`number` = '74s'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (card name is 'Sublime Epiphany'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`name` = 'Sublime Epiphany'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (card number is '74s'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`number` = '74s'\n\n* **Main Question (information about rulings):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`text` FROM `rulings` AS `T2` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T1` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`name` = 'Sublime Epiphany' AND `T1`.`number` = '74s'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `cards` and `rulings` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
