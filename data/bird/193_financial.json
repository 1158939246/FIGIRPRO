The `client_id` and `district_id` can be obtained from the `client` table. We will join the `disp` table with the `client` table to filter for clients with the \"OWNER\" type.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id`, `T1`.`district_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` WHERE `T2`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (clients with OWNER type):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id`, `T1`.`district_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`client_id` = `T2`.`client_id` WHERE `T2`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `client` and `disp` tables based on the `client_id`, and we are filtering for the \"OWNER\" type directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
