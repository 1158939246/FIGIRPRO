Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the total home team goal scored by players whose age are 30 years old and below.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to sum the `home_team_goal` from the `Match` table for players who are 30 years old or younger. This requires joining the `Match` table with the `Player` table to filter based on the players' ages.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`home_team_goal`) FROM `Match` AS `M` INNER JOIN `Player` AS `P` ON <join condition> WHERE <age condition>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** join condition\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `Match` table with the `Player` table using the player IDs. The player IDs are represented in the `Match` table by various player columns (e.g., `home_player_1`, `home_player_2`, etc.). We will need to check each of these columns to see if they match the `player_api_id` in the `Player` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `M.home_player_1 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_2 = P.player_api_id OR ...` (for all home player columns)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** age condition\n        * **Analysis:** To determine if a player is 30 years old or younger, we can calculate the age using the `birthday` column from the `Player` table. We will use the `strftime` function to extract the year from the birthday and compare it to the current year.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', P.birthday) <= 30`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (join condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `M.home_player_1 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_2 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_3 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_4 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_5 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_6 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_7 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_8 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_9 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_10 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_11 = P.player_api_id`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (age condition):**\n    * **SQL:** `strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', P.birthday) <= 30`\n\n* **Main Question (total home team goals):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(M.home_team_goal) FROM Match AS M INNER JOIN Player AS P ON (M.home_player_1 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_2 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_3 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_4 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_5 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_6 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_7 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_8 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_9 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_10 = P.player_api_id OR M.home_player_11 = P.player_api_id) WHERE strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', P.birthday) <= 30\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already quite efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
