Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In Scotland Premier League, which away team won the most during the 2010 season?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the away team that won the most matches in the specified league and season. This involves counting the number of wins for each away team and identifying the team with the maximum count. We will need to join the `Match`, `League`, and `Team` tables to get the necessary information.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`team_long_name` FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`away_team_api_id` = `T3`.`team_api_id` WHERE <conditions> GROUP BY `T3`.`team_api_id` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** conditions for the league and season\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the matches to only include those from the Scotland Premier League and the 2010 season.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Scotland Premier League' AND `T1`.`season` = '2009/2010'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** away team won\n        * **Analysis:** An away team is considered to have won if the goals scored by the away team are greater than the goals scored by the home team.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`away_team_goal` > `T1`.`home_team_goal`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (conditions for the league and season):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Scotland Premier League' AND `T1`.`season` = '2009/2010'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (away team won):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`away_team_goal` > `T1`.`home_team_goal`\n\n* **Main Question (team with the most wins):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`team_long_name` FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `League` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`league_id` = `T2`.`id` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`away_team_api_id` = `T3`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Scotland Premier League' AND `T1`.`season` = '2009/2010' AND `T1`.`away_team_goal` > `T1`.`home_team_goal` GROUP BY `T3`.`team_api_id` ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applied the required filters in the `WHERE` clause. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly structured to find the team with the most wins.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
