Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the patients with the normal glutamic pyruvic transaminase level, how many of them are male?\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of male patients with a specific condition regarding their GOT levels. We will need to filter the `Laboratory` table for patients with `GOT < 60` and then join it with the `Patient` table to filter for male patients.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal GOT level> AND <male patients>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal GOT level\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Laboratory` table using the `GOT` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`GOT` < 60\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal GOT level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`GOT` < 60\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Main Question (count of male patients with normal GOT level):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`GOT` < 60 AND `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
