Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List the name of leagues in which the average goals by the home team is higher than the away team in the 2009/2010 season.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average goals for both home and away teams and compare them. This requires aggregating data from the `Match` table and joining it with the `League` table to get the league names. We will filter the results for the 2009/2010 season.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `League`.`name` FROM `League` INNER JOIN `Match` ON `League`.`id` = `Match`.`league_id` WHERE `season` = '2009/2010' GROUP BY `League`.`name` HAVING AVG(home_team_goal) > AVG(away_team_goal)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (average goals comparison):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `League`.`name` FROM `League` INNER JOIN `Match` ON `League`.`id` = `Match`.`league_id` WHERE `Match`.`season` = '2009/2010' GROUP BY `League`.`name` HAVING AVG(home_team_goal) > AVG(away_team_goal)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `League` and `Match` tables based on their relationship, and the `HAVING` clause effectively filters the results based on the average goals.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
