Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What was the gas consumption peak month for SME customers in 2013?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the month with the highest gas consumption for SME customers in the year 2013. This involves filtering the `yearmonth` table for the relevant date range and customer segment, then aggregating the consumption data to find the peak month.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Date`, SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE <date is in 2013> AND <customer segment is SME> GROUP BY `Date` ORDER BY SUM(`Consumption`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** date is in 2013  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Date` column in the `yearmonth` table to include only those entries that fall within the year 2013. This can be done using a `BETWEEN` clause.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** customer segment is SME  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table where we select rows with a `Segment` of 'SME'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Segment` = 'SME'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (date is in 2013):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (customer segment is SME):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Segment` = 'SME'\n\n* **Main Question (peak month for gas consumption):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Date`, SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312' AND `T2`.`Segment` = 'SME' GROUP BY `T1`.`Date` ORDER BY SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to find the peak month.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
