Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many schools in merged Alameda have number of test takers less than 100?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of schools that meet two criteria: they are located in Alameda and have a number of test takers less than 100. The relevant information is found in the `satscores` table, specifically the `NumTstTakr` column for the number of test takers and the `sname` column for the school name. We also need to ensure that the schools are in the merged Alameda area, which can be inferred from the `County Name` column in the `satscores` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `satscores` WHERE <schools in merged Alameda> AND <number of test takers < 100>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** schools in merged Alameda\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `satscores` table for schools located in Alameda. The term \"merged\" suggests that we are looking for schools specifically in the county of Alameda.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cname` = 'Alameda'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** number of test takers < 100\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `NumTstTakr` column in the `satscores` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `NumTstTakr` < 100\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (schools in merged Alameda):**\n    * **SQL:** `cname` = 'Alameda'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (number of test takers < 100):**\n    * **SQL:** `NumTstTakr` < 100\n\n* **Main Question (count of schools):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `satscores` WHERE `cname` = 'Alameda' AND `NumTstTakr` < 100\n\n**3.
