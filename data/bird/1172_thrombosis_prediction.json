We need to filter based on two criteria: the patient's sex and the total bilirubin level.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <elevated total bilirubin count>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** elevated total bilirubin count  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `T-BIL` column to check if it is greater than or equal to 2.0.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male patients):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (elevated total bilirubin count):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\n\n* **Main Question (count of male patients with elevated total bilirubin):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `T2`.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
