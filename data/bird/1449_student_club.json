Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the name and major of members who had to spend more than a hundred dollars on an expense?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `major_name` of members who have expenses greater than 100. This requires joining the `member`, `expense`, and `major` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name`, `T1`.`major_name` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_major` = `T3`.`major_id` WHERE <cost > 100>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** cost > 100\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `cost` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`cost` > 100\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (cost > 100):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`cost` > 100\n\n* **Main Question (name and major of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`first_name`, `T2`.`last_name`, `T3`.`major_name` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` INNER JOIN `major` AS `T3` ON `T2`.`link_to_major` = `T3`.`major_id` WHERE `T1`.`cost` > 100\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationships, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
