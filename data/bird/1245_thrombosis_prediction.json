The 'Examination' table is necessary because it contains the 'Examination Date' column, which we need to filter for dates after 1997-01-01. The 'Laboratory' table is required because it includes the APTT values, which we need to check if they are less than 45 to determine if the result is normal. The 'Patient' table is not directly needed for this query as we are not filtering or aggregating based on patient-specific information, but rather focusing on the examination and laboratory results.
