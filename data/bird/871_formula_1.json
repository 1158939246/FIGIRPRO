                "plan": "**Question**: For the driver who had the Q2 time as 0:01:15 in race No. 347, where is he from?  \n**Evidence**: race number refers to raceId;\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the driver who had the Q2 time as 0:01:15 in race No. 347, where is he from?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the driver's nationality based on their Q2 time in a specific race. This requires joining the `qualifying` table to find the driver and then joining the `drivers` table to get the nationality.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`nationality` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <Q2 time is 0:01:15> AND <race number is 347>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Q2 time is 0:01:15\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `qualifying` table using the `q2` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`q2` = '0:01:15'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** race number is 347\n        * **Analysis:** This is also a straightforward filter on the `qualifying` table using the `raceId` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 347\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Q2 time is 0:01:15):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`q2` = '0:01:15'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (race number is 347):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`raceId` = 347\n\n* **Main Question (driver's nationality):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`nationality` FROM `qualifying` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`q2` = '0:01:15' AND `T1`.`raceId` = 347\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `qualifying` and `drivers` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
