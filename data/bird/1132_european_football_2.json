Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please provide the names of top three football players who are over 180 cm tall in alphabetical order.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the `player_name` from the `Player` table where the `height` is greater than 180 cm. We also need to order the results alphabetically and limit the output to the top three players.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE <height > 180> ORDER BY `player_name` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** height > 180\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `height` column in the `Player` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `height` > 180\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (height > 180):**\n    * **SQL:** `height` > 180\n\n* **Main Question (top three players):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `player_name` FROM `Player` WHERE `height` > 180 ORDER BY `player_name` ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It directly filters the `Player` table based on height, orders the results alphabetically, and limits the output to three entries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
