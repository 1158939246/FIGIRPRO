Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which customers, paying in CZK, consumed the most gas in 2011?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find customers who paid in CZK and consumed gas during the year 2011. The consumption data is in the `yearmonth` table, and we will filter based on the `Date` column. We will also need to join the `customers` table to filter by currency.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `CustomerID`, SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE <currency is CZK> AND <date is in 2011> GROUP BY `CustomerID` ORDER BY SUM(`Consumption`) DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** currency is CZK\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `customers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Currency` = 'CZK'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date is in 2011\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `yearmonth` table for dates between 201101 and 201112.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (currency is CZK):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Currency` = 'CZK'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date is in 2011):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112'\n\n* **Main Question (customers consuming the most gas):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`CustomerID`, SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `customers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Currency` = 'CZK' AND `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112' GROUP BY `T1`.`CustomerID` ORDER BY SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) DESC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are correctly applied to get the customers with the highest consumption.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
