Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many male patients have a normal level of both albumin and total protein?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count male patients who meet specific criteria for albumin and total protein levels. We will need to filter based on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table and the `ALB` and `TP` columns in the `Laboratory` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <normal albumin level> AND <normal total protein level>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** normal albumin level\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `ALB` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it falls within the normal range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`ALB` > 3.5 AND `L`.`ALB` < 5.5\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** normal total protein level\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `TP` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it falls within the normal range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`TP` BETWEEN 6.0 AND 8.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (normal albumin level):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`ALB` > 3.5 AND `L`.`ALB` < 5.5\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (normal total protein level):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`TP` BETWEEN 6.0 AND 8.5\n\n* **Main Question (count of male patients with normal levels):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `L`.`ALB` > 3.5 AND `L`.`ALB` < 5.5 AND `L`.`TP` BETWEEN 6.0 AND 8.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
