Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many male patients have their glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires a count of male patients whose `GOT` values are less than 60. We will need to filter the `Patient` table for males and join it with the `Laboratory` table to access the `GOT` values.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE <male patients> AND <GOT in normal range>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** male patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** GOT in normal range\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `GOT` column in the `Laboratory` table to ensure it is less than 60.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `L`.`GOT` < 60\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (male patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `P`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (GOT in normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** `L`.`GOT` < 60\n\n* **Main Question (count of male patients with normal GOT):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `L` ON `P`.`ID` = `L`.`ID` WHERE `P`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `L`.`GOT` < 60\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
