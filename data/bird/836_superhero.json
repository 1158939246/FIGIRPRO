We will use the `COUNT()` function to get the total number.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `superhero` WHERE <superheroes with first name John>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** superheroes with first name John\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superhero` table using the `full_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `full_name` LIKE 'John%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (superheroes with first name John):**\n    * **SQL:** `full_name` LIKE 'John%'\n\n* **Main Question (count of superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `superhero` WHERE `full_name` LIKE 'John%'\n\n**3.

It directly counts the number of superheroes whose full name starts with \"John\".\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
