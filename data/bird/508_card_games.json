Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (created by Aleksi Briclot):**\n    * **SQL:** `artist` = 'Aleksi Briclot'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (doesn't have a text box):**\n    * **SQL:** `isTextless` = 1\n\n* **Main Question (available printing types):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `availability` FROM `cards` WHERE `artist` = 'Aleksi Briclot' AND `isTextless` = 1\n\n**3.
