Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Indicate the name of the closed event whose cost has exceeded the budget the most.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the event name from the `event` table where the status is 'Closed' and the remaining budget is less than 0. We will use the `MIN(remaining)` to find the event with the most significant budget overage.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `event_name` FROM `event` WHERE <event is closed> AND <cost exceeds budget> ORDER BY <remaining> ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** event is closed\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `status` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `status` = 'Closed'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** cost exceeds budget\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `event` table with the `budget` table to access the `remaining` column. We will filter for cases where `remaining < 0`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `remaining` < 0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (event is closed):**\n    * **SQL:** `status` = 'Closed'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (cost exceeds budget):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2.remaining < 0` (where `T2` is the alias for the `budget` table)\n\n* **Main Question (name of the event):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1.event_name` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `budget` AS `T2` ON `T1.event_id` = `T2.link_to_event` WHERE `T1.status` = 'Closed' AND `T2.remaining < 0` ORDER BY `T2.remaining` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `event` and `budget` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
