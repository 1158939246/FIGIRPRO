What was the aim of debiting 3539 in total?\n    * **Analysis:** The question consists of two parts: the frequency of requests for account statements and the purpose of a specific debit amount. We will need to query the `order` table for both parts.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n      - For frequency: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `order` WHERE `account_id` = 3 AND `k_symbol` = 'SLUZBY' (assuming 'SLUZBY' refers to account statement requests).\n      - For aim of debiting: SELECT `k_symbol` FROM `order` WHERE `amount` = 3539;\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Frequency of account statement requests\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count how many times account number 3 has requested an account statement. This will involve filtering the `order` table by `account_id` and the appropriate `k_symbol`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `order` WHERE `account_id` = 3 AND `k_symbol` = 'SLUZBY'\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Aim of debiting 3539\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the purpose of the debit amount of 3539. This will involve filtering the `order` table by `amount`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `k_symbol` FROM `order` WHERE `amount` = 3539\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (frequency of account statement requests):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `order` WHERE `account_id` = 3 AND `k_symbol` = 'SLUZBY'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (aim of debiting 3539):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `k_symbol` FROM `order` WHERE `amount` = 3539\n\n* **Main Question (combined results):**\n    * **SQL:** \n      - For frequency: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `order` WHERE `account_id` = 3 AND `k_symbol` = 'SLUZBY';\n      - For aim of debiting: SELECT `k_symbol` FROM `order` WHERE `amount` = 3539;\n\n**3.
