Name all the races in descending order.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the races in 2005 and also list their names in descending order. We will need to filter the `races` table by the year 2005 and then perform a count and a selection of race names.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`raceId`), `name` FROM `races` WHERE <year = 2005> GROUP BY `name` ORDER BY `name` DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** year = 2005\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `year` column in the `races` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `year` = 2005\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (year = 2005):**\n    * **SQL:** `year` = 2005\n\n* **Main Question (count of races and names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`raceId`), `name` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2005 GROUP BY `name` ORDER BY `name` DESC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a `WHERE` clause to filter by year, and we are grouping by race name to count the races while also listing their names in descending order.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
