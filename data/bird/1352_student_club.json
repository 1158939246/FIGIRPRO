Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all the club members from \"Business\" major, how many of them wear medium size t-shirt? \n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of members who are in the \"Business\" major and have a t-shirt size of \"Medium\". This involves filtering the `member` table based on the `link_to_major` and `t_shirt_size` columns.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `member` WHERE <members from Business major> AND <wear medium size t-shirt>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** members from Business major\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the members based on the `link_to_major` which corresponds to the \"Business\" major in the `major` table. This requires a join between the `member` and `major` tables.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `link_to_major` = (SELECT `major_id` FROM `major` WHERE `major_name` = 'Business')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** wear medium size t-shirt\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `t_shirt_size` column in the `member` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `t_shirt_size` = 'Medium'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (members from Business major):**\n    * **SQL:** `link_to_major` = (SELECT `major_id` FROM `major` WHERE `major_name` = 'Business')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (wear medium size t-shirt):**\n    * **SQL:** `t_shirt_size` = 'Medium'\n\n* **Main Question (count of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `member` WHERE `link_to_major` = (SELECT `major_id` FROM `major` WHERE `major_name` = 'Business') AND `t_shirt_size` = 'Medium'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
