We will need to use the `MAX()` function on the `height_cm` column from the `superhero` table and then retrieve the corresponding superhero's name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `superhero_name` FROM `superhero` WHERE `height_cm` = <tallest height>\n\n    * **Sub-question:** tallest height\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation to find the maximum height from the `height_cm` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`height_cm`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question (tallest height):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`height_cm`)\n\n* **Main Question (name of the tallest superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `superhero_name` FROM `superhero` WHERE `height_cm` = (SELECT MAX(`height_cm`) FROM `superhero`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to find the maximum height and then filtering the main query based on that height.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
