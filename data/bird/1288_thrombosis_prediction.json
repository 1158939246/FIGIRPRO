This requires joining the `Laboratory` table (which contains the `TP` values) with the `Patient` table (which contains the `Diagnosis`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Filter for total protein lower than normal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition on the `TP` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (total protein lower than normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n* **Main Question (diagnosis of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Diagnosis` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`TP` < 6.0\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
