Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Lists all patients by ID who were diagnosed with Behcet's and had their exams between 01/01/1997 and 12/31/1997.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `ID` from the `Patient` table where the `Diagnosis` is 'Behcet' and the `Examination Date` falls within the specified range. This requires joining the `Patient` and `Examination` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <diagnosis is Behcet> AND <examination date is between 01/01/1997 and 12/31/1997>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** diagnosis is Behcet\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `Diagnosis` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'Behcet'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** examination date is between 01/01/1997 and 12/31/1997\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be applied to the `Examination` table using the `Examination Date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Examination Date` >= '1997-01-01' AND `T2`.`Examination Date` < '1998-01-01'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (diagnosis is Behcet):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'Behcet'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (examination date is between 01/01/1997 and 12/31/1997):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Examination Date` >= '1997-01-01' AND `T2`.`Examination Date` < '1998-01-01'\n\n* **Main Question (list of patient IDs):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`ID` FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`Diagnosis` = 'Behcet' AND `T2`.`Examination Date` >= '1997-01-01' AND `T2`.`Examination Date` < '1998-01-01'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
