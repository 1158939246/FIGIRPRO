Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** In terms of the fastest lap time, what is the name of the race which recorded the fastest lap speed by a racer?\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to find the race name associated with the fastest lap time. We will need to join the `results` table (which contains `fastestLapTime` and `raceId`) with the `races` table (which contains the race name) and filter for the minimum `fastestLapTime`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE <fastest lap time>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** fastest lap time\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the minimum `fastestLapTime` from the `results` table. Since `fastestLapTime` is stored as a string, we will need to convert it to a format that allows for proper comparison.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`fastestLapTime` = (SELECT MIN(`T1`.`fastestLapTime`) FROM `results` AS `T1`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (fastest lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`fastestLapTime` = (SELECT MIN(`T1`.`fastestLapTime`) FROM `results` AS `T1`)\n\n* **Main Question (race name with fastest lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name` FROM `results` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`fastestLapTime` = (SELECT MIN(`T1`.`fastestLapTime`) FROM `results` AS `T1`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by directly using the `MIN()` function in the main query without needing a nested query for the `fastestLapTime`. We can use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to get the race with the fastest lap time.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
