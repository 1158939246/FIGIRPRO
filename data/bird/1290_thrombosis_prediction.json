Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the examination date of the patient whose albumin is the highest in the normal range?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of the `ALB` column that falls within the normal range (greater than 3.5 and less than 5.5) and then retrieve the corresponding examination date from the `Examination` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Examination Date` FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`ALB` = (SELECT MAX(`ALB`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `ALB` > 3.5 AND `ALB` < 5.5)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum albumin value in the normal range.\n        * **Analysis:** This involves a straightforward aggregation on the `ALB` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`ALB`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `ALB` > 3.5 AND `ALB` < 5.5\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum albumin value in the normal range):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`ALB`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `ALB` > 3.5 AND `ALB` < 5.5\n\n* **Main Question (examination date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Examination Date` FROM `Examination` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Laboratory` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`ALB` = (SELECT MAX(`ALB`) FROM `Laboratory` WHERE `ALB` > 3.5 AND `ALB` < 5.5)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient as it uses an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, and it retrieves the examination date corresponding to the maximum albumin value found in the specified range.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
