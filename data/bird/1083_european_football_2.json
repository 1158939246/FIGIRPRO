We will need to select the `player_name` and the maximum `overall_rating` from the `Player_Attributes` table, and we will use a `JOIN` to connect it with the `Player` table to get the player's name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`overall_rating` = MAX(`T2`.`overall_rating`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the maximum overall_rating\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation query to find the maximum value of `overall_rating`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (maximum overall_rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes`\n\n* **Main Question (player with the strongest overall strength):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`player_name` FROM `Player` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`player_api_id` = `T2`.`player_api_id` WHERE `T2`.`overall_rating` = (SELECT MAX(`overall_rating`) FROM `Player_Attributes`)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
