This requires us to first identify the driver with the 91st rank based on points and then retrieve their wins.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `wins` FROM `driverStandings` WHERE `driverId` = (SELECT `driverId` FROM `driverStandings` ORDER BY `points` DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 90)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the driver who is ranked 91st based on points.\n        * **Analysis:** We will order the `driverStandings` by `points` in descending order and use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to get the 91st driver.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `driverId` FROM `driverStandings` ORDER BY `points` DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 90\n\n**2.
