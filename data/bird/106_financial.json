Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the biggest amount of transaction that the client whose card was opened in 1996/10/21 made?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum transaction amount for a client associated with a card opened on a specific date. This involves joining the `card`, `disp`, `account`, and `trans` tables to link the card to the client and then to their transactions.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T4`.`amount`) FROM `trans` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T3` ON `T4`.`account_id` = `T3`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `card` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`disp_id` = `T1`.`disp_id` WHERE `T1`.`issued` = '1996-10-21'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the client whose card was opened on 1996/10/21\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward; we will filter the `card` table for the specific issue date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`issued` = '1996-10-21'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (card opened on 1996/10/21):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`issued` = '1996-10-21'\n\n* **Main Question (maximum transaction amount):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT MAX(`T4`.`amount`) FROM `trans` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `account` AS `T3` ON `T4`.`account_id` = `T3`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` INNER JOIN `card` AS `T1` ON `T2`.`disp_id` = `T1`.`disp_id` WHERE `T1`.`issued` = '1996-10-21'\n\n**3.
