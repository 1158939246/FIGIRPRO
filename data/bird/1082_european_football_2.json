We need to filter the `League` table based on the `country_id` that corresponds to Germany in the `Country` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `League` WHERE `country_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `Country` WHERE `name` = 'Germany')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the country_id for Germany.\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to find the `id` of the country named 'Germany' in the `Country` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `id` FROM `Country` WHERE `name` = 'Germany'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (country_id for Germany):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `id` FROM `Country` WHERE `name` = 'Germany'\n\n* **Main Question (list of leagues from Germany):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `name` FROM `League` WHERE `country_id` = (SELECT `id` FROM `Country` WHERE `name` = 'Germany')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It uses a subquery to filter the leagues based on the country ID for Germany.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
