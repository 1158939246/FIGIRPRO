This requires joining the `cards` table to find the `uuid` for \"Ancestor's Chosen\".\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`type` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`language` = 'German' AND `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** language = 'German'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `foreign_data` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`language` = 'German'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** name = 'Ancestor's Chosen'\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `cards` table to find the specific card.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (language = 'German'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`language` = 'German'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (name = 'Ancestor's Chosen'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n* **Main Question (German type of the card):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`type` FROM `foreign_data` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T1`.`language` = 'German' AND `T2`.`name` = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
