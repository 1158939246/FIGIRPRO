This requires joining the `posts` table with the `users` table based on the `OwnerUserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Location` FROM `users` WHERE `Id` = (SELECT `OwnerUserId` FROM `posts` WHERE `Title` = 'Eliciting priors from experts')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the OwnerUserId for the post titled \"Eliciting priors from experts\".\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward query to filter the `posts` table by the title.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `OwnerUserId` FROM `posts` WHERE `Title` = 'Eliciting priors from experts'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (OwnerUserId for the post):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `OwnerUserId` FROM `posts` WHERE `Title` = 'Eliciting priors from experts'\n\n* **Main Question (location of the owner):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `Location` FROM `users` WHERE `Id` = (SELECT `OwnerUserId` FROM `posts` WHERE `Title` = 'Eliciting priors from experts')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using a subquery to get the `OwnerUserId` and then using it to filter the `users` table for the `Location`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
