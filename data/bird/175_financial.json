This requires joining the `disp`, `account`, and `client` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`account_id`) FROM `account` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `disp` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`account_id` = `T2`.`account_id` WHERE <owner disposition> AND <frequency is 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** owner disposition\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `disp` table where we check if the `type` is 'OWNER'.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`type` = 'OWNER'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** frequency is 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n        * **Analysis:** This filter is applied to the `account` table using the `frequency` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`frequency` = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\n\n**2.
