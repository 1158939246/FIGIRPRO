Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the full name and date of birth of Austrian drivers born between 1981 and 1991?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `forename`, `surname`, and `dob` of drivers who are Austrian and whose date of birth falls within the specified range. This requires filtering based on nationality and date of birth.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`dob` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE <Austrian nationality> AND <date of birth between 1981 and 1991>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Austrian nationality  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `nationality` column in the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`nationality` = 'Austrian'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** date of birth between 1981 and 1991  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `dob` column to ensure it falls within the specified range. We can use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the `dob` date.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', T1.dob) BETWEEN '1981' AND '1991'`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Austrian nationality):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`nationality` = 'Austrian'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date of birth between 1981 and 1991):**  \n    * **SQL:** `STRFTIME('%Y', T1.dob) BETWEEN '1981' AND '1991'`\n\n* **Main Question (full name and date of birth):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`dob` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`nationality` = 'Austrian' AND STRFTIME('%Y', T1.dob) BETWEEN '1981' AND '1991'\n\n**3.

We are directly filtering the `drivers` table based on the nationality and date of birth criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
