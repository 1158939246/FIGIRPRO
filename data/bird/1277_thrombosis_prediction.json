Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many patients have a normal anti-DNA level, yet their data are not recorded?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count unique patients based on two conditions: they have a normal anti-DNA level (where `DNA < 8`) and their data is not recorded (where `Description IS NULL`).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <normal anti-DNA level> AND <data not recorded>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal anti-DNA level\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `Examination` table using the `DNA` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`DNA` < 8\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** data not recorded\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `Patient` table using the `Description` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`Description` IS NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal anti-DNA level):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`DNA` < 8\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (data not recorded):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Description` IS NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of unique patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`ID`) FROM `Patient` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`DNA` < 8 AND `T1`.`Description` IS NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
