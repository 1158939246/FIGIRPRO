To filter these superheroes, we need to join the `superhero` table with the `publisher` table based on the `publisher_id` and filter by the publisher name 'Marvel Comics'.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT AVG(`T1`.`height_cm`) FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `publisher` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`publisher_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <superheroes from Marvel Comics>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** superheroes from Marvel Comics  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `publisher` table using the `publisher_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`publisher_name` = 'Marvel Comics'\n\n**2.
