Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Find the full name, Wiki Pedia page link, and date of birth of German drivers born between 1971 and 1985. \n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `forename`, `surname`, `url`, and `dob` from the `drivers` table. The filtering criteria include nationality being 'German' and the date of birth falling between 1971 and 1985.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`url`, `T1`.`dob` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE <nationality is German> AND <dob is between 1971 and 1985> ORDER BY `T1`.`dob` DESC\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** nationality is German\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `nationality` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`nationality` = 'German'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** dob is between 1971 and 1985\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `dob` column using the `BETWEEN` operator.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`dob` BETWEEN '1971-01-01' AND '1985-12-31'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (nationality is German):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`nationality` = 'German'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (dob is between 1971 and 1985):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`dob` BETWEEN '1971-01-01' AND '1985-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (selecting required fields):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname`, `T1`.`url`, `T1`.`dob` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`nationality` = 'German' AND `T1`.`dob` BETWEEN '1971-01-01' AND '1985-12-31' ORDER BY `T1`.`dob` DESC\n\n**3.

It directly selects the required columns and applies the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause, followed by ordering the results.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
