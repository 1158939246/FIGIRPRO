This requires us to first identify the minimum potential and then retrieve the corresponding preferred foot.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `preferred_foot` FROM `Player_Attributes` WHERE `potential` = (SELECT MIN(`potential`) FROM `Player_Attributes`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find the lowest potential\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward aggregation query to find the minimum value of the `potential` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MIN(`potential`)\n\n**2.
