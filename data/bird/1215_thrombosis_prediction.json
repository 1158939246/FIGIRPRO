Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For all female patients with total protein (TP) beyond the normal index, what is the deviation of their TP index from the normal?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the deviation of the TP index from the normal value of 8.5 for female patients whose TP is greater than 8.5. This requires filtering based on the `SEX` and `TP` columns and calculating the deviation.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (TP - 8.5) AS deviation FROM Laboratory AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SEX = 'F' AND T1.TP > 8.5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Patient` table using the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** T2.SEX = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** total protein (TP) beyond the normal index\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Laboratory` table based on the `TP` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** T1.TP > 8.5\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** deviation of TP index from normal\n        * **Analysis:** This is calculated as `TP - 8.5`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (T1.TP - 8.5)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** T2.SEX = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (total protein (TP) beyond the normal index):**\n    * **SQL:** T1.TP > 8.5\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (deviation of TP index from normal):**\n    * **SQL:** (T1.TP - 8.5)\n\n* **Main Question (deviation of TP for female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (T1.TP - 8.5) AS deviation FROM Laboratory AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SEX = 'F' AND T1.TP > 8.5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
