Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List all the short name of the football team that had a home team goal of 10? \n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to select the `team_short_name` from the `Team` table based on the condition that the `home_team_goal` in the `Match` table equals 10. This requires a join between the `Match` and `Team` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`team_short_name` FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`home_team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE <home team goal = 10>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** home team goal = 10\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Match` table using the `home_team_goal` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`home_team_goal` = 10\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (home team goal = 10):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`home_team_goal` = 10\n\n* **Main Question (short name of the football team):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`team_short_name` FROM `Match` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Team` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`home_team_api_id` = `T2`.`team_api_id` WHERE `T1`.`home_team_goal` = 10\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
