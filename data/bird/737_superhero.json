This information is stored in the `superhero` table, specifically in the `race_id` column, which references the `race` table to get the actual race name.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Copycat'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Retrieve the race of Copycat\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `superhero` table for the superhero named \"Copycat\" and joining it with the `race` table to get the race name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Copycat'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Retrieve the race of Copycat):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Copycat'\n\n* **Main Question (race of Copycat):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`race` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Copycat'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `race` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
