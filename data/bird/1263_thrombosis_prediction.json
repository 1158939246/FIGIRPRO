Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients whose level of Hematoclit isn't normal, which patient has the highest anti-Cardiolipin antibody concentration? Please list his or her ID.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the patient ID with the highest `aCL IgA` concentration while filtering out patients with a normal `HCT` level. The `HCT` level is considered normal if it falls between 29 and 52.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `ID` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <Hematoclit isn't normal> ORDER BY MAX(`aCL IgA`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Hematoclit isn't normal\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `HCT` column in the `Laboratory` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`HCT` <= 29 OR `T1`.`HCT` >= 52\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** highest anti-Cardiolipin antibody concentration\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the maximum value of `aCL IgA` for the filtered patients. This will be done in the `ORDER BY` clause.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** MAX(`T1`.`aCL IgA`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Hematoclit isn't normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`HCT` <= 29 OR `T1`.`HCT` >= 52\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (highest anti-Cardiolipin antibody concentration):**\n    * **SQL:** MAX(`T1`.`aCL IgA`)\n\n* **Main Question (patient ID with highest concentration):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`ID` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`HCT` <= 29 OR `T1`.`HCT` >= 52 ORDER BY `T1`.`aCL IgA` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to find the maximum concentration.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
