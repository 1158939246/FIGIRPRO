Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List down at least five full names of Demi-God superheroes.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `full_name` of superheroes whose race is 'Demi-God'. This requires a join between the `superhero` and `race` tables to filter by race.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE <race is Demi-God> LIMIT 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** race is Demi-God\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `race` table using the `race` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Demi-God'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (race is Demi-God):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`race` = 'Demi-God'\n\n* **Main Question (full names of Demi-God superheroes):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`full_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `race` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`race_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`race` = 'Demi-God' LIMIT 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `LIMIT 5` ensures we only retrieve five names.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
