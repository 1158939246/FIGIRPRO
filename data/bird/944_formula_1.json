Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage difference between the champion's time and the last driver's time. This requires us to identify both the champion's finishing time and the last driver's finishing time for the specified race.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT ( (last_driver_time - champion_time) / last_driver_time ) * 100 AS speed_difference FROM <sub-queries>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Get the champion's finishing time for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n        * **Analysis:** The champion's time can be found in the `results` table where the position is 1 for the race corresponding to the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT time FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix') AND position = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Get the last driver's finishing time for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n        * **Analysis:** The last driver's time can be found in the `results` table where the position is the maximum for the race corresponding to the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT time FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix') AND position = (SELECT MAX(position) FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix'))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (champion's finishing time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT time FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix') AND position = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (last driver's finishing time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT time FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix') AND position = (SELECT MAX(position) FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix'))\n\n* **Main Question (percentage difference):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT ( (last_driver_time - champion_time) / last_driver_time ) * 100 AS speed_difference FROM (SELECT (SELECT time FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix') AND position = 1) AS champion_time, (SELECT time FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix') AND position = (SELECT MAX(position) FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year = 2008 AND name = 'Australian Grand Prix'))) AS last_driver_time)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by directly calculating the times in a single query without nesting too deeply.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
