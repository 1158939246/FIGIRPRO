This involves retrieving the fastest lap speeds for both races and applying the percentage formula.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT (fastestLapSpeed(853) - fastestLapSpeed(854)) / fastestLapSpeed(853) * 100 AS percent_faster FROM <join drivers and results>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** fastestLapSpeed for race 853\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the fastest lap speed for race 853 where Paul di Resta participated. This requires joining the `results` table with the `drivers` table to filter by driver name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 853 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** fastestLapSpeed for race 854\n        * **Analysis:** Similar to sub-question 1, we need to find the fastest lap speed for race 854.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 854 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (fastestLapSpeed for race 853):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 853 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (fastestLapSpeed for race 854):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 854 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 853 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta') - (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 854 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta') / (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results AS R INNER JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.raceId = 853 AND D.forename = 'Paul' AND D.surname = 'di Resta') * 100 AS percent_faster\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by combining the sub-queries into a single query using a common table expression (CTE) or by using a single SELECT statement with JOINs.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
