Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What percentage is Landon Donovan's overall rating higher than Jordan Bowery on 2013/7/12?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the percentage difference between the overall ratings of Landon Donovan and Jordan Bowery. This requires fetching their ratings from the `Player_Attributes` table and filtering by the date.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT ( (Landon_Overall - Jordan_Overall) / Landon_Overall ) * 100 AS percentage FROM (SELECT <Landon's overall rating> AS Landon_Overall, <Jordan's overall rating> AS Jordan_Overall FROM <join and filter>)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Fetch Landon Donovan's overall rating\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `Player` table to find Landon Donovan and then join with `Player_Attributes` to get his overall rating.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `overall_rating` FROM `Player` AS `P1` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA1` ON `P1`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `PA1`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE `P1`.`player_name` = 'Landon Donovan' AND `PA1`.`date` = '2013/7/12'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Fetch Jordan Bowery's overall rating\n        * **Analysis:** Similar to Sub-question 1, we need to filter for Jordan Bowery.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `overall_rating` FROM `Player` AS `P2` INNER JOIN `Player_Attributes` AS `PA2` ON `P2`.`player_fifa_api_id` = `PA2`.`player_fifa_api_id` WHERE `P2`.`player_name` = 'Jordan Bowery' AND `PA2`.`date` = '2013/7/12'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Landon Donovan's overall rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT PA1.overall_rating FROM Player AS P1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS PA1 ON P1.player_fifa_api_id = PA1.player_fifa_api_id WHERE P1.player_name = 'Landon Donovan' AND PA1.date = '2013/7/12'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Jordan Bowery's overall rating):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT PA2.overall_rating FROM Player AS P2 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS PA2 ON P2.player_fifa_api_id = PA2.player_fifa_api_id WHERE P2.player_name = 'Jordan Bowery' AND PA2.date = '2013/7/12'\n\n* **Main Question (percentage calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT ((Landon_Overall - Jordan_Overall) / Landon_Overall) * 100 AS percentage FROM (SELECT (SELECT PA1.overall_rating FROM Player AS P1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS PA1 ON P1.player_fifa_api_id = PA1.player_fifa_api_id WHERE P1.player_name = 'Landon Donovan' AND PA1.date = '2013/7/12') AS Landon_Overall, (SELECT PA2.overall_rating FROM Player AS P2 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS PA2 ON P2.player_fifa_api_id = PA2.player_fifa_api_id WHERE P2.player_name = 'Jordan Bowery' AND PA2.date = '2013/7/12') AS Jordan_Overall)\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by using a single query with `JOIN` to fetch both ratings in one go, avoiding nested subqueries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
