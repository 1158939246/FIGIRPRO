And what is the date and expenses exactly?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the customer who made a payment of 124.05 on '2012-08-24' and then calculate their total spending in January 2012. The spending is represented by the `Consumption` column in the `yearmonth` table. We will also need to retrieve the specific dates and expenses.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Date`, SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `transactions_1k` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Price` = 124.05 AND `T2`.`Date` = '2012-08-24' AND `T1`.`Date` LIKE '201201%' GROUP BY `T1`.`Date`\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Identify the customer who paid 124.05 on '2012-08-24'.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `transactions_1k` table to find the `CustomerID` associated with this transaction.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `Price` = 124.05 AND `Date` = '2012-08-24'\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Calculate the total spending in January 2012 for the identified customer.\n    * **Analysis:** We will use the `yearmonth` table to sum the `Consumption` for the identified customer where the date falls within January 2012.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` WHERE `CustomerID` = <CustomerID from Sub-question 1> AND `Date` LIKE '201201%'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Identify customer):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `Price` = 124.05 AND `Date` = '2012-08-24'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Calculate total spending):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` WHERE `CustomerID` = (SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE `Price` = 124.05 AND `Date` = '2012-08-24') AND `Date` LIKE '201201%'\n\n* **Main Question (total spending and date):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Date`, SUM(`T1`.`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `transactions_1k` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`CustomerID` = `T2`.`CustomerID` WHERE `T2`.`Price` = 124.05 AND `T2`.`Date` = '2012-08-24' AND `T1`.`Date` LIKE '201201%' GROUP BY `T1`.`Date`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the `yearmonth` and `transactions_1k` tables and filtering based on the conditions provided.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
