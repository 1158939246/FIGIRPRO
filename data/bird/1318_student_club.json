Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the event that has the highest attendance of the students from the Student_Club?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the event with the maximum count of attendees. This requires counting the number of attendees for each event and then selecting the event with the highest count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `event_name` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` GROUP BY `T1`.`event_id` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of attendees for each event\n        * **Analysis:** This is achieved by grouping the attendance records by event and counting the number of attendees for each event.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of attendees for each event):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`)\n\n* **Main Question (event with highest attendance):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`event_name` FROM `event` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `attendance` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`event_id` = `T2`.`link_to_event` GROUP BY `T1`.`event_id` ORDER BY COUNT(`T2`.`link_to_event`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `event` and `attendance` tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause allows us to count the number of attendees for each event. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results to find the event with the highest attendance.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
