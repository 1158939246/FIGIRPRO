Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** For the owner user of post No. 65041, what is his/her reputation points?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the `Reputation` of the user who owns the post with `Id = 65041`. This requires us to join the `posts` table with the `users` table based on the `OwnerUserId`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Reputation` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Id` = 65041\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (reputation points):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`Reputation` FROM `posts` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `users` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`OwnerUserId` = `T2`.`Id` WHERE `T1`.`Id` = 65041\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `posts` and `users` tables based on the relationship between `OwnerUserId` and `Id`. The `WHERE` clause directly filters for the specific post.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
