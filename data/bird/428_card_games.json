The `sets` table contains the set name, and the `set_translations` table contains the translations associated with the set. We will join these two tables based on the `setCode` in `set_translations` and the `code` in `sets`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`translation` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T1`.`id` = 5\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Retrieve the name of the set\n        * **Analysis:** This is straightforward as we will select the `name` column from the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Retrieve the translation of the set\n        * **Analysis:** This will be selected from the `set_translations` table, which we will join with the `sets` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`translation`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (name of the set):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`name`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (translation of the set):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`translation`\n\n* **Main Question (name and translation):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`name`, `T2`.`translation` FROM `sets` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `set_translations` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`code` = `T2`.`setCode` WHERE `T1`.`id` = 5\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly specifies the condition for the set ID.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
