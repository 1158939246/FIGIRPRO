The `gender` information is stored in the `gender` table, while the superhero's name is in the `superhero` table. We need to join these two tables based on the `gender_id` in the `superhero` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`gender` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Agent 13';\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Main Question (gender of Agent 13):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`gender` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `gender` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`gender_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T1`.`superhero_name` = 'Agent 13';\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `superhero` and `gender` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
