Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What is the Simplified Chinese translation of the name of the set \"Eighth Edition\"?  \n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `translation` from the `set_translations` table where the `name` of the set is 'Eighth Edition' and the `language` is 'Chinese Simplified'. This requires a join with the `sets` table to get the correct `setCode`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`translation` FROM `set_translations` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Eighth Edition' AND `T1`.`language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify the set code for \"Eighth Edition\"  \n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `sets` table to find the `code` corresponding to the name 'Eighth Edition'.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Eighth Edition'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Identify the language for Simplified Chinese  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `set_translations` table.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (set code for \"Eighth Edition\"):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` = 'Eighth Edition'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (language for Simplified Chinese):**  \n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n* **Main Question (translation of the set name):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`translation` FROM `set_translations` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `sets` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`setCode` = `T2`.`code` WHERE `T2`.`name` = 'Eighth Edition' AND `T1`.`language` = 'Chinese Simplified'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `set_translations` and `sets` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
