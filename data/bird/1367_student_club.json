We need to count the number of members associated with each college and then find the college with the maximum count.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `major.college` FROM `major` INNER JOIN `member` ON `major.major_id` = `member.link_to_major` GROUP BY `major.college` ORDER BY COUNT(`member.member_id`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of members per college  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves counting the number of members linked to each college through the `major` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`member.member_id`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (count of members per college):**  \n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`member.member_id`)\n\n* **Main Question (college with most members):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT `major.college` FROM `major` INNER JOIN `member` ON `major.major_id` = `member.link_to_major` GROUP BY `major.college` ORDER BY COUNT(`member.member_id`) DESC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `major` and `member` tables based on their relationship, and the `GROUP BY` clause allows us to aggregate the counts by college. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results to find the college with the maximum count.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
