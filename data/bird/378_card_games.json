List the IDs.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the IDs of cards that have both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` not null. This means we will filter the `cards` table based on these conditions.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `id` FROM `cards` WHERE <both cardKingdomFoilId and cardKingdomId are not null>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** both cardKingdomFoilId and cardKingdomId are not null\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition that can be applied directly to the `cards` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (both cardKingdomFoilId and cardKingdomId are not null):**\n    * **SQL:** `cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL`\n\n* **Main Question (IDs of foiled cards):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `id` FROM `cards` WHERE `cardKingdomFoilId` IS NOT NULL AND `cardKingdomId` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
