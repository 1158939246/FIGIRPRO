We will need to filter the `superhero` table based on the `full_name` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Charles Chandler'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** full_name = 'Charles Chandler'\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `superhero` table using the `full_name` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`full_name` = 'Charles Chandler'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (full_name = 'Charles Chandler'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`full_name` = 'Charles Chandler'\n\n* **Main Question (name of the superhero):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`superhero_name` FROM `superhero` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`full_name` = 'Charles Chandler'\n\n**3.

It directly retrieves the `superhero_name` based on the specified `full_name`.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
