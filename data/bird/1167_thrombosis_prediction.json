Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (patients are male):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`SEX` = 'M'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (date is in 1998):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'\n\n* **Main Question (average number of male patients tested):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(COUNT(`T1`.`ID`), 12) FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T2`.`SEX` = 'M' AND `T1`.`Date` BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31'\n\n**3.
