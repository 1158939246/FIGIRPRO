We will filter the members based on their position.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(`cost`), COUNT(`event_id`)) FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <position other than a member>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** position other than a member\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `member` table using the `position` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`position` != 'Member'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (position other than a member):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`position` != 'Member'\n\n* **Main Question (average amount paid):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT DIVIDE(SUM(`T1`.`cost`), COUNT(`T1`.`link_to_budget`)) FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE `T2`.`position` != 'Member'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `expense` and `member` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
