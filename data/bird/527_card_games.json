List them in descending order of dates.  \n**Evidence**: rulings refers to text; card named and designed by Kev Walker refers to artist = 'Kev Walker'; descending order of dates refers to MAX(date);\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the rulings for the card named and designed by Kev Walker? List them in descending order of dates.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `text` from the `rulings` table for cards designed by Kev Walker. This requires joining the `cards` table to filter by the artist and then ordering the results by the `date` in descending order.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`text` FROM `rulings` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE <artist is Kev Walker> ORDER BY <date DESC>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** artist is Kev Walker\n        * **Analysis:** This condition will filter the `cards` table based on the `artist` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`artist` = 'Kev Walker'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (artist is Kev Walker):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`artist` = 'Kev Walker'\n\n* **Main Question (rulings for the card):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`text` FROM `rulings` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `cards` AS `T2` ON `T3`.`uuid` = `T2`.`uuid` WHERE `T2`.`artist` = 'Kev Walker' ORDER BY `T3`.`date` DESC\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `rulings` and `cards` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The ordering is also correctly applied.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
