Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List emails of people who paid more than 20 dollars from 9/10/2019 to 11/19/2019.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to retrieve the `email` from the `member` table for those members who have expenses greater than 20 dollars within the specified date range. This requires joining the `expense` table with the `member` table.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`email` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE <cost > 20> AND <expense_date BETWEEN '2019-09-10' and '2019-11-19'>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** cost > 20\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `expense` table using the `cost` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`cost` > 20\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** expense_date BETWEEN '2019-09-10' and '2019-11-19'\n        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `expense` table using the `expense_date` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` BETWEEN '2019-09-10' AND '2019-11-19'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (cost > 20):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`cost` > 20\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (expense_date BETWEEN '2019-09-10' and '2019-11-19'):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`expense_date` BETWEEN '2019-09-10' AND '2019-11-19'\n\n* **Main Question (emails of members):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`email` FROM `expense` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `member` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_member` = `T2`.`member_id` WHERE `T1`.`cost` > 20 AND `T1`.`expense_date` BETWEEN '2019-09-10' AND '2019-11-19'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
