Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How much did customer 6 consume in total between August and November 2013?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to sum the `Consumption` for customer 6 from the `yearmonth` table, filtering the records based on the date range specified (from 201308 to 201311).\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` WHERE `CustomerID` = 6 AND <date between 201308 and 201311>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** date between 201308 and 201311\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `Date` column in the `yearmonth` table to ensure it falls within the specified range.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Date` BETWEEN '201308' AND '201311'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (date between 201308 and 201311):**\n    * **SQL:** `Date` BETWEEN '201308' AND '201311'\n\n* **Main Question (total consumption):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT SUM(`Consumption`) FROM `yearmonth` WHERE `CustomerID` = 6 AND `Date` BETWEEN '201308' AND '201311'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
