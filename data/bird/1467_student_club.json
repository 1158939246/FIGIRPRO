Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Calculate the total amount spent on speaker gifts and list the name of the event they were spent on.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to sum the `spent` amounts from the `budget` table where the `category` is 'Speaker Gifts'. We also need to join this with the `event` table to get the event names associated with these budgets.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`event_name`, SUM(`T1`.`spent`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE <category is Speaker Gifts> GROUP BY `T2`.`event_name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** category is Speaker Gifts\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `budget` table using the `category` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`category` = 'Speaker Gifts'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (category is Speaker Gifts):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`category` = 'Speaker Gifts'\n\n* **Main Question (total amount spent and event names):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`event_name`, SUM(`T1`.`spent`) FROM `budget` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `event` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`link_to_event` = `T2`.`event_id` WHERE `T1`.`category` = 'Speaker Gifts' GROUP BY `T2`.`event_name`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `budget` and `event` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we get the total spent per event.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
