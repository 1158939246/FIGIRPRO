Please give a total number of \"value for money\" gas stations in each country.\n    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count the number of gas stations categorized as \"value for money\" for each country. We will need to group the results by country and filter the gas stations based on the segment.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Country`, COUNT(`GasStationID`) FROM `gasstations` WHERE <segment is \"value for money\"> GROUP BY `Country`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** segment is \"value for money\"\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Segment` column in the `gasstations` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Segment` = 'Value for money'\n\n**2.
