We also need to filter the results to only include those from the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `results` WHERE <finished race> AND <2008 Australian Grand Prix>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** finished race\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward condition where we check if the `time` column is not null.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `time` IS NOT NULL\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** 2008 Australian Grand Prix\n        * **Analysis:** We need to identify the `raceId` for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix from the `races` table. This requires filtering the `races` table by the year and name of the race.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `raceId` IN (SELECT `raceId` FROM `races` WHERE `year` = 2008 AND `name` = 'Australian Grand Prix')\n\n**2.
