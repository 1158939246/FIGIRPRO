Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many meeting events were held in 2020?  \n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of events, specifically those of type 'Meeting' that occurred in the year 2020. We will use the `COUNT()` function for this purpose and filter based on the `type` and `event_date` columns in the `event` table.  \n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `event` WHERE <meeting events> AND <held in 2020>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** meeting events  \n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `event` table using the `type` column.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `type` = 'Meeting'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** held in 2020  \n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `event_date` column to check if the year is 2020. We can use the `STRFTIME()` function to extract the year from the `event_date`.  \n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `event_date`) = '2020'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (meeting events):**  \n    * **SQL:** `type` = 'Meeting'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (held in 2020):**  \n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `event_date`) = '2020'\n\n* **Main Question (count of meeting events in 2020):**  \n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `event` WHERE `type` = 'Meeting' AND STRFTIME('%Y', `event_date`) = '2020'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are directly filtering the `event` table based on the required conditions without unnecessary joins or subqueries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
