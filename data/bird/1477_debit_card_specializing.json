We will then group the results by year and order them to find the maximum.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT STRFTIME('%Y', `Date`) AS `Year`, SUM(`Price`) AS `TotalGasUse` FROM `transactions_1k` WHERE <currency is EUR> GROUP BY `Year` ORDER BY `TotalGasUse` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** currency is EUR\n    * **Analysis:** We need to join the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table to filter transactions based on the currency. The `Currency` column in the `customers` table indicates the currency used.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `CustomerID` IN (SELECT `CustomerID` FROM `customers` WHERE `Currency` = 'EUR')\n\n**2.

Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient.
