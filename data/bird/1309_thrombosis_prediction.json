Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Please list a patient's platelet level if it is within the normal range and if he or she is diagnosed with MCTD.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to select the `PLT` column from the `Laboratory` table, ensuring that the platelet level is within the normal range and that the patient is diagnosed with MCTD. This requires joining the `Laboratory` table with the `Patient` table based on the `ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`PLT` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE <platelet level is normal> AND <diagnosed with MCTD>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** platelet level is normal\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `PLT` column to ensure it is greater than 100 and less than 400.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` > 100 AND `T1`.`PLT` < 400\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** diagnosed with MCTD\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `Diagnosis` column in the `Patient` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Diagnosis` = 'MCTD'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (platelet level is normal):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`PLT` > 100 AND `T1`.`PLT` < 400\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (diagnosed with MCTD):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Diagnosis` = 'MCTD'\n\n* **Main Question (select platelet level):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`PLT` FROM `Laboratory` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Patient` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`ID` = `T2`.`ID` WHERE `T1`.`PLT` > 100 AND `T1`.`PLT` < 400 AND `T2`.`Diagnosis` = 'MCTD'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the relevant tables and applied the necessary filters directly in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
