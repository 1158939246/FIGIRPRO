Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Among the patients with a normal Ig G level, how many of them have symptoms?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of patients who meet two criteria: they have a normal Ig G level and their symptoms are not null. The `Laboratory` table contains the `IGG` levels, and the `Examination` table contains the `Symptoms`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE <normal Ig G level> AND <have symptoms>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** normal Ig G level\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be directly applied to the `Laboratory` table using the `IGG` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`IGG` > 900 AND `E`.`IGG` < 2000\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** have symptoms\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied to the `Examination` table using the `Symptoms` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `E`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (normal Ig G level):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`IGG` > 900 AND `E`.`IGG` < 2000\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (have symptoms):**\n    * **SQL:** `E`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n* **Main Question (count of patients):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Patient` AS `P` INNER JOIN `Examination` AS `E` ON `P`.`ID` = `E`.`ID` WHERE `E`.`IGG` > 900 AND `E`.`IGG` < 2000 AND `E`.`Symptoms` IS NOT NULL\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
