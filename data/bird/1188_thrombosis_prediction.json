Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** How many female patients born in 1964 were admitted to the hospital? List them by ID.\n    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of female patients who meet specific criteria. We need to filter based on sex, birth year, and admission status. The output should include the IDs of these patients.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`ID`) FROM `Patient` WHERE <female patients> AND <born in 1964> AND <admitted to the hospital>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** female patients\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `SEX` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `SEX` = 'F'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** born in 1964\n        * **Analysis:** We can extract the year from the `Birthday` column using the `YEAR()` function.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** YEAR(`Birthday`) = 1964\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** admitted to the hospital\n        * **Analysis:** This is another straightforward filter on the `Admission` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `Admission` = '+'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (female patients):**\n    * **SQL:** `SEX` = 'F'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (born in 1964):**\n    * **SQL:** YEAR(`Birthday`) = 1964\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (admitted to the hospital):**\n    * **SQL:** `Admission` = '+'\n\n* **Main Question (count of female patients born in 1964 who were admitted):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`ID`) FROM `Patient` WHERE `SEX` = 'F' AND YEAR(`Birthday`) = 1964 AND `Admission` = '+'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. It uses a single `SELECT` statement with appropriate `WHERE` conditions to filter the data.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
