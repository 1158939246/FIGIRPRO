The `operation` column in the `trans` table will help us filter for credit card withdrawals.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `account_id` FROM `account` WHERE `account_id` IN (SELECT `account_id` FROM `trans` WHERE <amount is less than average> AND <year is 1998> AND <operation is credit card withdrawal>)\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** amount is less than average\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average amount of transactions for the year 1998 and filter transactions that are less than this average.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `amount` < (SELECT AVG(`amount`) FROM `trans` WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) = '1998')\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** year is 1998\n        * **Analysis:** This will be applied directly in the filtering of the transactions.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) = '1998'\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** operation is credit card withdrawal\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `operation` column in the `trans` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `operation` = 'VYBER KARTOU'\n\n**2.
