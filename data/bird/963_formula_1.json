The lap times are stored in the `lapTimes` table, and we need to join this with the `drivers` table to filter by nationality.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <lap time less than 120 seconds> AND <driver nationality is French>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** lap time less than 120 seconds\n        * **Analysis:** The lap time is stored as a string in the `time` column of the `lapTimes` table. We need to convert this time format into seconds and check if it is less than 120.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** STRFTIME('%s', `T1`.`time`) < 120\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** driver nationality is French\n        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `drivers` table using the `nationality` column.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`nationality` = 'French'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (lap time less than 120 seconds):**\n    * **SQL:** STRFTIME('%s', `T1`.`time`) < 120\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (driver nationality is French):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`nationality` = 'French'\n\n* **Main Question (count of French drivers with lap time less than 120 seconds):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `T1`.`driverId`) FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `drivers` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE STRFTIME('%s', `T1`.`time`) < 120 AND `T2`.`nationality` = 'French'\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
