Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** List down top 3 German drivers who have the shortest average pit stop duration and were born between 1980-1985.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the average pit stop duration for drivers, filter by nationality (German), and filter by birth year (1980-1985). The final result should be the top 3 drivers based on the shortest average pit stop duration.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `pitStops` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE <born between 1980-1985> GROUP BY `T1`.`driverId` ORDER BY <average pit stop duration> ASC LIMIT 3\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** born between 1980-1985\n        * **Analysis:** This condition can be applied directly to the `dob` column in the `drivers` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`dob` BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1985-12-31'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** average pit stop duration\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average duration from the `pitStops` table, which can be done using `SUM(duration) / COUNT(duration)`. We will use the `duration` column from the `pitStops` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** AVG(`T2`.`duration`)\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (born between 1980-1985):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`dob` BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1985-12-31'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (average pit stop duration):**\n    * **SQL:** AVG(`T2`.`duration`)\n\n* **Main Question (top 3 German drivers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`forename`, `T1`.`surname` FROM `drivers` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `pitStops` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`driverId` = `T2`.`driverId` WHERE `T1`.`dob` BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1985-12-31' AND `T1`.`nationality` = 'German' GROUP BY `T1`.`driverId` ORDER BY AVG(`T2`.`duration`) ASC LIMIT 3\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the `drivers` and `pitStops` tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate the average duration for each driver.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
