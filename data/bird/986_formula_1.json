Please indicate the time in milliseconds.\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the race associated with the minimum time recorded for the 1st lap. The `lapTimes` table contains the `time` for each lap, and we need to filter for the first lap (lap = 1). We will also need to join with the `races` table to get the race details.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, MIN(`T1`.`milliseconds`) FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`lap` = 1 GROUP BY `T2`.`raceId` ORDER BY MIN(`T1`.`milliseconds`) ASC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Fastest 1st lap time\n        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `lapTimes` table for the first lap and finding the minimum time.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`lap` = 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Join with races to get race details\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `lapTimes` table with the `races` table to get the race name associated with the lap time.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`raceId` = `T1`.`raceId`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (fastest 1st lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** `T1`.`lap` = 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (join with races):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`raceId` = `T1`.`raceId`\n\n* **Main Question (fastest 1st lap time):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T2`.`name`, MIN(`T1`.`milliseconds`) FROM `lapTimes` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `races` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`raceId` = `T2`.`raceId` WHERE `T1`.`lap` = 1 GROUP BY `T2`.`raceId` ORDER BY MIN(`T1`.`milliseconds`) ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We are using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we are grouping by race, and the `ORDER BY` clause allows us to find the minimum time.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
