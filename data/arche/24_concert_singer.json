We will then find the stadiums with the lowest and highest average attendance rates and count the number of concerts held at each.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT stadium.Name, COUNT(concert.concert_ID) AS concert_count \n    FROM concert \n    INNER JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID \n    GROUP BY stadium.Stadium_ID \n    HAVING <lowest and highest average attendance rates>\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Calculate average attendance rate for each stadium.\n    * **Analysis:** The average attendance rate can be calculated as the total attendance divided by the stadium's capacity. We need to sum the attendance for each concert and divide it by the capacity of the stadium.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    AVG(attendance) / stadium.Capacity\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Identify the lowest and highest average attendance rates.\n    * **Analysis:** We will need to find the minimum and maximum values of the average attendance rates calculated in the previous step.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    MIN(average_attendance_rate) AND MAX(average_attendance_rate)\n    ```\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average attendance rate):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT stadium.Name, \n           SUM(stadium.Average) / COUNT(concert.concert_ID) AS average_attendance_rate \n    FROM concert \n    INNER JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID \n    GROUP BY stadium.Stadium_ID\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (lowest and highest average attendance rates):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT MIN(average_attendance_rate) AS lowest_rate, \n           MAX(average_attendance_rate) AS highest_rate \n    FROM (SELECT SUM(stadium.Average) / COUNT(concert.concert_ID) AS average_attendance_rate \n          FROM concert \n          INNER JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID \n          GROUP BY stadium.Stadium_ID)\n    ```\n\n* **Main Question (stadiums with lowest and highest average attendance rates):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT stadium.Name, COUNT(concert.concert_ID) AS concert_count \n    FROM concert \n    INNER JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID \n    GROUP BY stadium.Stadium_ID \n    HAVING AVG(stadium.Average) / stadium.Capacity = (SELECT MIN(average_attendance_rate) FROM (SELECT SUM(stadium.Average) / COUNT(concert.concert_ID) AS average_attendance_rate FROM concert INNER JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID GROUP BY stadium.Stadium_ID)) \n    OR AVG(stadium.Average) / stadium.Capacity = (SELECT MAX(average_attendance_rate) FROM (SELECT SUM(stadium.Average) / COUNT(concert.concert_ID) AS average_attendance_rate FROM concert INNER JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID GROUP BY stadium.Stadium_ID))\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by calculating the average attendance rate directly in the main query and using a `WITH` clause to improve readability.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
