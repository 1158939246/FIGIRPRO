Therefore, we need the 'stadium' table to get the capacity and the highest attendance figures. We also need to find the highest attendance rate of the Balmoor stadium, which requires us to know its capacity and attendance. The 'stadium' table contains the necessary information about the stadiums, including their names and capacities. The 'concert' table is necessary to link concerts to stadiums, but it does not directly provide attendance figures. However, since the question involves comparing attendance rates, we will need to assume that the attendance figures are derived from the concerts held at each stadium, which is indirectly related through the 'concert' table. Thus, we will use the 'stadium' table to find the relevant stadiums and their capacities, and the 'concert' table to establish the relationship between concerts and stadiums. The 'singer_in_concert' and 'singer' tables are not necessary for this specific query as they do not provide information relevant to stadium attendance rates.",
