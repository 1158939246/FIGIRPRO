Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the names of the stadiums with the highest and lowest average attendance rates, and how many concerts have been held in each of them?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the average attendance rate for each stadium, which is derived from the attendance amount divided by the stadium's capacity. We will then find the stadiums with the highest and lowest average attendance rates and count the number of concerts held in each.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Name`, AVG(`T1`.`Average` / `T1`.`Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate`, COUNT(`T2`.`concert_ID`) AS `Concert_Count` FROM `stadium` AS `T1` LEFT JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Stadium_ID` = `T2`.`Stadium_ID` GROUP BY `T1`.`Stadium_ID` HAVING `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MAX(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`)) OR `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MIN(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`))\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate average attendance rate\n        * **Analysis:** This involves calculating the average attendance rate for each stadium by dividing the `Average` by `Capacity`.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** AVG(`T1`.`Average` / `T1`.`Capacity`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count concerts held in each stadium\n        * **Analysis:** We will count the number of concerts associated with each stadium using a LEFT JOIN with the `concert` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`concert_ID`)\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Identify stadiums with highest and lowest attendance rates\n        * **Analysis:** We will use the HAVING clause to filter for stadiums that have either the maximum or minimum average attendance rates.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** HAVING `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MAX(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`)) OR `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MIN(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average attendance rate):**\n    * **SQL:** AVG(`T1`.`Average` / `T1`.`Capacity`)\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count concerts):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(`T2`.`concert_ID`)\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (highest and lowest attendance rates):**\n    * **SQL:** HAVING `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MAX(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`)) OR `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MIN(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`))\n\n* **Main Question (names of stadiums and concert counts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Name`, AVG(`T1`.`Average` / `T1`.`Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate`, COUNT(`T2`.`concert_ID`) AS `Concert_Count` FROM `stadium` AS `T1` LEFT JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Stadium_ID` = `T2`.`Stadium_ID` GROUP BY `T1`.`Stadium_ID` HAVING `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MAX(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`)) OR `Attendance_Rate` = (SELECT MIN(`Attendance_Rate`) FROM (SELECT AVG(`Average` / `Capacity`) AS `Attendance_Rate` FROM `stadium` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`))\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by calculating the average attendance rate in a single subquery and then joining it with the concert table to get the concert counts.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
