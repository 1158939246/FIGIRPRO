                "plan": "**Question**: Suppose Gayfield Park stadium had a tenth of the capacity of Hampden Park stadium, which stadiums have the lowest and highest average attendance rates respectively, and how many concerts have they each held?  \n**Evidence**: Attendance rate is calculated by dividing attendance amount by the capacity of the stadium.\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** Which stadiums have the lowest and highest average attendance rates respectively, and how many concerts have they each held?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the attendance rate for each stadium, which requires knowing the total attendance and the capacity of each stadium. We will then find the stadiums with the lowest and highest average attendance rates and count the number of concerts held at each.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Stadium_ID`, `Attendance Rate`, COUNT(`concert_ID`) FROM `stadium` AS `S` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `C` ON `S`.`Stadium_ID` = `C`.`Stadium_ID` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID` ORDER BY `Attendance Rate` ASC LIMIT 1; SELECT `Stadium_ID`, `Attendance Rate`, COUNT(`concert_ID`) FROM `stadium` AS `S` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `C` ON `S`.`Stadium_ID` = `C`.`Stadium_ID` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID` ORDER BY `Attendance Rate` DESC LIMIT 1;\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Calculate the attendance rate for each stadium.\n    * **Analysis:** The attendance rate is calculated by dividing the total attendance (which we can assume is represented by the `Average` column in the `stadium` table) by the capacity of the stadium. We need to adjust the capacity of Gayfield Park to be a tenth of Hampden Park's capacity.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `Attendance Rate` = `Average` / `Capacity` (with adjustment for Gayfield Park)\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Count the number of concerts held at each stadium.\n    * **Analysis:** We will count the number of concerts for each stadium by grouping by `Stadium_ID`.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** COUNT(`concert_ID`) FROM `concert` GROUP BY `Stadium_ID`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (attendance rate calculation):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT \n        Stadium_ID, \n        CASE \n            WHEN Name = 'Gayfield Park' THEN Average / (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Hampden Park') / 10 \n            ELSE Average / Capacity \n        END AS Attendance_Rate \n    FROM stadium\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count concerts):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT \n        Stadium_ID, \n        COUNT(concert_ID) AS Concert_Count \n    FROM concert \n    GROUP BY Stadium_ID\n    ```\n\n* **Main Question (combine results):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT \n        S.Stadium_ID, \n        Attendance_Rate, \n        C.Concert_Count \n    FROM \n        (SELECT \n            Stadium_ID, \n            CASE \n                WHEN Name = 'Gayfield Park' THEN Average / (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Hampden Park') / 10 \n                ELSE Average / Capacity \n            END AS Attendance_Rate \n        FROM stadium) AS S \n    INNER JOIN \n        (SELECT \n            Stadium_ID, \n            COUNT(concert_ID) AS Concert_Count \n        FROM concert \n        GROUP BY Stadium_ID) AS C \n    ON S.Stadium_ID = C.Stadium_ID \n    ORDER BY Attendance_Rate ASC LIMIT 1; \n    SELECT \n        S.Stadium_ID, \n        Attendance_Rate, \n        C.Concert_Count \n    FROM \n        (SELECT \n            Stadium_ID, \n            CASE \n                WHEN Name = 'Gayfield Park' THEN Average / (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Hampden Park') / 10 \n                ELSE Average / Capacity \n            END AS Attendance_Rate \n        FROM stadium) AS S \n    INNER JOIN \n        (SELECT \n            Stadium_ID, \n            COUNT(concert_ID) AS Concert_Count \n        FROM concert \n        GROUP BY Stadium_ID) AS C \n    ON S.Stadium_ID = C.Stadium_ID \n    ORDER BY Attendance_Rate DESC LIMIT 1;\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* We can combine the calculations for both the lowest and highest attendance rates into a single query using `UNION ALL` to get both results in one go.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
