Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What will be the ages and names of the \"Home Visits\" concert singers on its 20th anniversary?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the names and ages of singers who performed at the \"Home Visits\" concert. The age will be calculated based on the date of birth and the concert's 20th anniversary date. We also need to ensure that only singers who performed at concerts in Stark Park are included.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Name`, (YEAR('2014-01-01') - `T3`.`Age`) AS `Age` FROM `singer` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`Singer_ID` IN (SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T4` ON `T2`.`Stadium_ID` = `T4`.`Stadium_ID` WHERE `T4`.`Name` = 'Stark\\'s Park') AND `T3`.`Singer_ID` IN (SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T2`.`concert_Name` = 'Home Visits')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Find singers who performed at concerts in Stark Park.\n        * **Analysis:** We need to join the `singer_in_concert`, `concert`, and `stadium` tables to filter singers based on the stadium name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T4` ON `T2`.`Stadium_ID` = `T4`.`Stadium_ID` WHERE `T4`.`Name` = 'Stark\\'s Park'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Find singers who performed at the \"Home Visits\" concert.\n        * **Analysis:** This requires filtering the `singer_in_concert` table based on the concert name.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T2`.`concert_Name` = 'Home Visits'\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (singers in Stark Park):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T4` ON `T2`.`Stadium_ID` = `T4`.`Stadium_ID` WHERE `T4`.`Name` = 'Stark\\'s Park'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (singers in Home Visits):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T2`.`concert_Name` = 'Home Visits'\n\n* **Main Question (ages and names of singers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`Name`, (YEAR('2014-01-01') - `T3`.`Age`) AS `Age` FROM `singer` AS `T3` WHERE `T3`.`Singer_ID` IN (SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T4` ON `T2`.`Stadium_ID` = `T4`.`Stadium_ID` WHERE `T4`.`Name` = 'Stark\\'s Park') AND `T3`.`Singer_ID` IN (SELECT `T1`.`Singer_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T2`.`concert_Name` = 'Home Visits')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by combining the two sub-queries into a single `INNER JOIN` operation to filter singers who performed at both concerts.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
