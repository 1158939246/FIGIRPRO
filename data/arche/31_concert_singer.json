This requires joining the `concert`, `singer_in_concert`, and `singer` tables. We will filter for concerts held at Somerset Park and specifically check for the \"Week 2\" concert.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, <percentage of female singers> FROM `concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Stadium_ID` = `T2`.`Stadium_ID` INNER JOIN `singer_in_concert` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T3`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `singer` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Singer_ID` = `T4`.`Singer_ID` WHERE `T2`.`Name` = 'Somerset Park' AND `T1`.`concert_Name` = 'Week 2'\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** percentage of female singers\n        * **Analysis:** To calculate the percentage of female singers, we need to count the total number of singers and the number of female singers (where `Is_male` is false). The percentage can be calculated as (number of female singers / total number of singers) * 100.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS `female_percentage`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (percentage of female singers):**\n    * **SQL:** (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS `female_percentage`\n\n* **Main Question (concert details and female percentage):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS `female_percentage` FROM `concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Stadium_ID` = `T2`.`Stadium_ID` INNER JOIN `singer_in_concert` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T3`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `singer` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Singer_ID` = `T4`.`Singer_ID` WHERE `T2`.`Name` = 'Somerset Park' AND `T1`.`concert_Name` = 'Week 2' GROUP BY `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient. We have used `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and applied the required filters. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures we get the correct aggregation for the percentage calculation.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
