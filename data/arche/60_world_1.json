We will then calculate how many times larger the area of the highest density country is compared to the lowest density country.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Country with highest density`, `Area of highest density country`, `Area of lowest density country`, `Area of highest density country` / `Area of lowest density country` FROM <sub-queries>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Country with the highest population density where the majority speaks English\n        * **Analysis:** We need to filter countries where English is the majority language and calculate the population density. This requires joining the `countrylanguage` and `country` tables.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Code`, `Population` / `SurfaceArea` AS `Density` FROM `country` AS `C` INNER JOIN `countrylanguage` AS `CL` ON `C`.`Code` = `CL`.`CountryCode` WHERE `CL`.`Language` = 'English' AND `CL`.`Percentage` > 50 ORDER BY `Density` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Country with the lowest population density\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the population density for all countries and find the one with the lowest density.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `Code`, `Population` / `SurfaceArea` AS `Density` FROM `country` ORDER BY `Density` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (country with highest density where majority speaks English):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Code`, `C`.`Population` / `C`.`SurfaceArea` AS `Density`, `C`.`SurfaceArea` FROM `country` AS `C` INNER JOIN `countrylanguage` AS `CL` ON `C`.`Code` = `CL`.`CountryCode` WHERE `CL`.`Language` = 'English' AND `CL`.`Percentage` > 50 ORDER BY `Density` DESC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (country with lowest density):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `C`.`Code`, `C`.`Population` / `C`.`SurfaceArea` AS `Density`, `C`.`SurfaceArea` FROM `country` AS `C` ORDER BY `Density` ASC LIMIT 1\n\n* **Main Question (calculate how many times larger):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `HighDensityCountry`.`Code`, `HighDensityCountry`.`SurfaceArea`, `LowDensityCountry`.`SurfaceArea`, `HighDensityCountry`.`SurfaceArea` / `LowDensityCountry`.`SurfaceArea` AS `SizeRatio` FROM (SELECT `C`.`Code`, `C`.`Population` / `C`.`SurfaceArea` AS `Density`, `C`.`SurfaceArea` FROM `country` AS `C` INNER JOIN `countrylanguage` AS `CL` ON `C`.`Code` = `CL`.`CountryCode` WHERE `CL`.`Language` = 'English' AND `CL`.`Percentage` > 50 ORDER BY `Density` DESC LIMIT 1) AS `HighDensityCountry`, (SELECT `C`.`Code`, `C`.`Population` / `C`.`SurfaceArea` AS `Density`, `C`.`SurfaceArea` FROM `country` AS `C` ORDER BY `Density` ASC LIMIT 1) AS `LowDensityCountry`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by directly joining the results of the two sub-queries to avoid nested queries.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
