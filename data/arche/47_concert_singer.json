Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the ID and name of post-2012 concerts featuring more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert, and what is the ratio of the number of singers in both concerts?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find concerts after 2012, compare the number of singers in these concerts to the number of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert, and calculate the ratio of these two counts. The `singer_in_concert` table will help us count the number of singers per concert, while the `concert` table will provide the concert details.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, <ratio> FROM `concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T2`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T1`.`Year` > '2012' AND <more singers than Happy Tonight>\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the number of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert first. This requires filtering the `concert` table for the \"Happy Tonight\" theme and joining with the `singer_in_concert` table to count the singers.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `COUNT(T2.Singer_ID) > (SELECT COUNT(T3.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS T3 INNER JOIN concert AS T4 ON T3.concert_ID = T4.concert_ID WHERE T4.Theme = 'Happy Tonight')`\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** ratio of the number of singers in both concerts\n        * **Analysis:** We need to calculate the ratio of the number of singers in the current concert to the number of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `COUNT(T2.Singer_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(T3.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS T3 INNER JOIN concert AS T4 ON T3.concert_ID = T4.concert_ID WHERE T4.Theme = 'Happy Tonight') AS ratio`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(T2.Singer_ID) > (SELECT COUNT(T3.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS T3 INNER JOIN concert AS T4 ON T3.concert_ID = T4.concert_ID WHERE T4.Theme = 'Happy Tonight')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (ratio of the number of singers):**\n    * **SQL:** COUNT(T2.Singer_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(T3.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS T3 INNER JOIN concert AS T4 ON T3.concert_ID = T4.concert_ID WHERE T4.Theme = 'Happy Tonight') AS ratio\n\n* **Main Question (ID and name of concerts):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT T1.concert_ID, T1.concert_Name, COUNT(T2.Singer_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(T3.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS T3 INNER JOIN concert AS T4 ON T3.concert_ID = T4.concert_ID WHERE T4.Theme = 'Happy Tonight') AS ratio FROM concert AS T1 INNER JOIN singer_in_concert AS T2 ON T1.concert_ID = T2.concert_ID WHERE T1.Year > '2012' GROUP BY T1.concert_ID, T1.concert_Name HAVING COUNT(T2.Singer_ID) > (SELECT COUNT(T3.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS T3 INNER JOIN concert AS T4 ON T3.concert_ID = T4.concert_ID WHERE T4.Theme = 'Happy Tonight')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by ensuring that we perform the necessary joins and aggregations efficiently. We will use `GROUP BY` to aggregate the number of singers per concert and apply the `HAVING` clause to filter based on the count of singers.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
