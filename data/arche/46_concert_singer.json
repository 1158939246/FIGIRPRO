                "plan": "**Question**: If singer Joe Sharp performed in every concert, what are the IDs and names of concerts held after 2012 that have more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert, and how many times is it?\n\n**1. Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** If singer Joe Sharp performed in every concert, what are the IDs and names of concerts held after 2012 that have more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert, and how many times is it?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find concerts held after 2012, count the number of singers for each concert, and compare this count to the number of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert. We will also need to ensure that Joe Sharp performed in every concert.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT `concert_ID`, `concert_Name`, COUNT(`singer_ID`) \n    FROM `concert` AS `C` \n    INNER JOIN `singer_in_concert` AS `S` ON `C`.`concert_ID` = `S`.`concert_ID` \n    WHERE `C`.`Year` > '2012' AND `C`.`concert_ID` IN (SELECT `concert_ID` FROM `singer_in_concert` WHERE `Singer_ID` = (SELECT `Singer_ID` FROM `singer` WHERE `Name` = 'Joe Sharp')) \n    GROUP BY `C`.`concert_ID`, `C`.`concert_Name` \n    HAVING COUNT(`singer_ID`) > (SELECT COUNT(`S2`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `S2` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `C2` ON `S2`.`concert_ID` = `C2`.`concert_ID` WHERE `C2`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight')\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 1:** Concerts held after 2012\n    * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `concert` table using the `Year` column.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `C.Year > '2012'`\n\n* **Sub-question 2:** Count of singers in each concert\n    * **Analysis:** We will join the `concert` and `singer_in_concert` tables to count the number of singers for each concert.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `COUNT(S.singer_ID)`\n\n* **Sub-question 3:** Count of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert\n    * **Analysis:** We need to filter the `concert` table for the \"Happy Tonight\" theme and count the number of singers.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `SELECT COUNT(S2.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS S2 INNER JOIN concert AS C2 ON S2.concert_ID = C2.concert_ID WHERE C2.Theme = 'Happy Tonight'`\n\n* **Sub-question 4:** Ensure Joe Sharp performed in every concert\n    * **Analysis:** We will filter the concerts to include only those where Joe Sharp is a performer.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** `C.concert_ID IN (SELECT concert_ID FROM singer_in_concert WHERE Singer_ID = (SELECT Singer_ID FROM singer WHERE Name = 'Joe Sharp'))`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (concerts held after 2012):**\n    * **SQL:** `C.Year > '2012'`\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (count of singers in each concert):**\n    * **SQL:** `COUNT(S.singer_ID)`\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (count of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert):**\n    * **SQL:** `SELECT COUNT(S2.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS S2 INNER JOIN concert AS C2 ON S2.concert_ID = C2.concert_ID WHERE C2.Theme = 'Happy Tonight'`\n\n* **Sub-question 4 (ensure Joe Sharp performed in every concert):**\n    * **SQL:** `C.concert_ID IN (SELECT concert_ID FROM singer_in_concert WHERE Singer_ID = (SELECT Singer_ID FROM singer WHERE Name = 'Joe Sharp'))`\n\n* **Main Question (IDs and names of concerts):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT C.concert_ID, C.concert_Name, COUNT(S.singer_ID) \n    FROM concert AS C \n    INNER JOIN singer_in_concert AS S ON C.concert_ID = S.concert_ID \n    WHERE C.Year > '2012' AND C.concert_ID IN (SELECT concert_ID FROM singer_in_concert WHERE Singer_ID = (SELECT Singer_ID FROM singer WHERE Name = 'Joe Sharp')) \n    GROUP BY C.concert_ID, C.concert_Name \n    HAVING COUNT(S.singer_ID) > (SELECT COUNT(S2.Singer_ID) FROM singer_in_concert AS S2 INNER JOIN concert AS C2 ON S2.concert_ID = C2.concert_ID WHERE C2.Theme = 'Happy Tonight')\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and filtering based on the required conditions. \n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
