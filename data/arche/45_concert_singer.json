Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** What are the ID and name of the post-2012 concert features more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert, what is the ratio of the number of singers in both concerts?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find concerts that occurred after 2012 and have more singers than the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert. We will also calculate the ratio of the number of singers in both concerts.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`concert_ID` = `T3`.`concert_ID`) / (SELECT COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T5` ON `T4`.`concert_ID` = `T5`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T5`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight') AS `singer_ratio` FROM `concert` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`Year` > '2012' AND (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`concert_ID` = `T1`.`concert_ID`) > (SELECT COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T5` ON `T4`.`concert_ID` = `T5`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T5`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight')\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Count of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of singers in the concert with the theme \"Happy Tonight\".\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T5` ON `T4`.`concert_ID` = `T5`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T5`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Count of singers in each concert\n        * **Analysis:** We need to count the number of singers for each concert to compare with the \"Happy Tonight\" concert.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`concert_ID` = `T1`.`concert_ID`\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (Count of singers in the \"Happy Tonight\" themed concert):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T5` ON `T4`.`concert_ID` = `T5`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T5`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight')\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (Count of singers in each concert):**\n    * **SQL:** (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`concert_ID` = `T1`.`concert_ID`)\n\n* **Main Question (ID and name of post-2012 concerts with more singers):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`concert_ID` = `T1`.`concert_ID`) / (SELECT COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T5` ON `T4`.`concert_ID` = `T5`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T5`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight') AS `singer_ratio` FROM `concert` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`Year` > '2012' AND (SELECT COUNT(`T2`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T2` WHERE `T2`.`concert_ID` = `T1`.`concert_ID`) > (SELECT COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`) FROM `singer_in_concert` AS `T4` INNER JOIN `concert` AS `T5` ON `T4`.`concert_ID` = `T5`.`concert_ID` WHERE `T5`.`Theme` = 'Happy Tonight')\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query can be simplified by using a `JOIN` instead of nested subqueries for counting singers. This will improve performance and readability.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
