The 'singer_in_concert' table is necessary to link singers to specific concerts, but since we are interested in the song 'Gentleman', we need to ensure that the singer associated with that song is identified. The 'singer' table provides the necessary details about the singer, while the 'concert' table is not directly needed for this specific query since we are not querying concert details. Therefore, the 'singer' table is the primary source for the required information, and the 'singer_in_concert' table is indirectly relevant to ensure the singer's participation in concerts, but it is not strictly necessary for this query.
