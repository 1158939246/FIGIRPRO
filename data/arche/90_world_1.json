Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** If the GNP of the top three countries with the longest life expectancy decreases by 2%, which continent has a per capita GNP growth rate at least two points higher than Europe?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the top three countries based on life expectancy, calculate their new GNP after a 2% decrease, and then determine the per capita GNP growth rate for each continent. Finally, we will compare these rates to find continents with a growth rate at least two points higher than Europe.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT continent \n    FROM (SELECT continent, (SUM(GNP) / SUM(Population)) AS per_capita_GNP_growth_rate \n          FROM country \n          INNER JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode \n          GROUP BY continent) AS continent_GNP \n    WHERE per_capita_GNP_growth_rate > (SELECT (SUM(GNP) / SUM(Population)) + 2 \n                                          FROM country \n                                          INNER JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode \n                                          WHERE continent = 'Europe')\n    ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Top three countries with the longest life expectancy\n        * **Analysis:** We will select the top three countries based on the `LifeExpectancy` column from the `country` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy \n        FROM country \n        ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC \n        LIMIT 3\n        ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Calculate the new GNP after a 2% decrease\n        * **Analysis:** For the top three countries identified in Sub-question 1, we will calculate the new GNP by multiplying the original GNP by 0.98.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SELECT Code, GNP * 0.98 AS NewGNP \n        FROM country \n        WHERE Code IN (SELECT Code FROM (SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy FROM country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 3))\n        ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Calculate per capita GNP for each continent\n        * **Analysis:** We will calculate the per capita GNP for each continent using the new GNP values from Sub-question 2 and the population from the `city` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SELECT continent, SUM(NewGNP) / SUM(Population) AS per_capita_GNP \n        FROM (SELECT country.Code, country.GNP * 0.98 AS NewGNP, city.Population, country.Continent \n              FROM country \n              INNER JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode \n              WHERE country.Code IN (SELECT Code FROM (SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy FROM country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 3)))\n        GROUP BY continent\n        ```\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (top three countries with longest life expectancy):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT Code \n    FROM (SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy FROM country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 3)\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (calculate new GNP after 2% decrease):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT Code, GNP * 0.98 AS NewGNP \n    FROM country \n    WHERE Code IN (SELECT Code FROM (SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy FROM country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 3))\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (calculate per capita GNP for each continent):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT continent, SUM(NewGNP) / SUM(Population) AS per_capita_GNP \n    FROM (SELECT country.Code, country.GNP * 0.98 AS NewGNP, city.Population, country.Continent \n          FROM country \n          INNER JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode \n          WHERE country.Code IN (SELECT Code FROM (SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy FROM country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 3)))\n    GROUP BY continent\n    ```\n\n* **Main Question (continents with per capita GNP growth rate at least two points higher than Europe):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT continent \n    FROM (SELECT continent, (SUM(NewGNP) / SUM(Population)) AS per_capita_GNP_growth_rate \n          FROM (SELECT country.Code, country.GNP * 0.98 AS NewGNP, city.Population, country.Continent \n                FROM country \n                INNER JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode \n                WHERE country.Code IN (SELECT Code FROM (SELECT Code, LifeExpectancy FROM country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 3)))\n          GROUP BY continent) AS continent_GNP \n    WHERE per_capita_GNP_growth_rate > (SELECT (SUM(GNP) / SUM(Population)) + 2 \n                                          FROM country \n                                          INNER JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode \n                                          WHERE continent = 'Europe')\n    ```\n\n**3.
