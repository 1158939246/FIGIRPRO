We also need to filter the stadiums based on the condition that Gayfield Park has one-tenth the capacity of Hampden Park. Finally, we will count the number of concerts held in each stadium.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T1.Name, COUNT(T2.concert_ID) \n    FROM stadium AS T1 \n    LEFT JOIN concert AS T2 ON T1.Stadium_ID = T2.Stadium_ID \n    WHERE <condition for highest and lowest average attendance rates> \n    GROUP BY T1.Name\n    ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Calculate average attendance rate for each stadium.\n        * **Analysis:** The average attendance rate can be calculated as the total attendance divided by the capacity. We need to join the `stadium` and `concert` tables to get the attendance data.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SELECT T1.Name, SUM(T2.attendance) / T1.Capacity AS average_attendance_rate \n        FROM stadium AS T1 \n        LEFT JOIN concert AS T2 ON T1.Stadium_ID = T2.Stadium_ID \n        GROUP BY T1.Name\n        ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Filter stadiums based on the condition that Gayfield Park has one-tenth the capacity of Hampden Park.\n        * **Analysis:** We need to find the capacities of both stadiums and apply the condition.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Gayfield Park') = 0.1 * (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Hampden Park')\n        ```\n\n    * **Sub-question 3:** Identify the highest and lowest average attendance rates.\n        * **Analysis:** We can use the results from Sub-question 1 to find the maximum and minimum average attendance rates.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** \n        ```sql\n        SELECT MAX(average_attendance_rate), MIN(average_attendance_rate) FROM (previous sub-query)\n        ```\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (average attendance rate):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T1.Name, SUM(T2.attendance) / T1.Capacity AS average_attendance_rate \n    FROM stadium AS T1 \n    LEFT JOIN concert AS T2 ON T1.Stadium_ID = T2.Stadium_ID \n    GROUP BY T1.Name\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (condition for Gayfield Park and Hampden Park):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Gayfield Park') = 0.1 * (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Hampden Park')\n    ```\n\n* **Sub-question 3 (highest and lowest average attendance rates):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT MAX(average_attendance_rate), MIN(average_attendance_rate) FROM (previous sub-query)\n    ```\n\n* **Main Question (names of stadiums and concert counts):**\n    * **SQL:** \n    ```sql\n    SELECT T1.Name, COUNT(T2.concert_ID) \n    FROM stadium AS T1 \n    LEFT JOIN concert AS T2 ON T1.Stadium_ID = T2.Stadium_ID \n    WHERE (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Gayfield Park') = 0.1 * (SELECT Capacity FROM stadium WHERE Name = 'Hampden Park') \n    AND T1.Name IN (SELECT Name FROM (SELECT T1.Name, SUM(T2.attendance) / T1.Capacity AS average_attendance_rate \n    FROM stadium AS T1 \n    LEFT JOIN concert AS T2 ON T1.Stadium_ID = T2.Stadium_ID \n    GROUP BY T1.Name) AS rates WHERE average_attendance_rate = (SELECT MAX(average_attendance_rate) FROM (previous sub-query)) OR average_attendance_rate = (SELECT MIN(average_attendance_rate) FROM (previous sub-query)))\n    GROUP BY T1.Name\n    ```\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The final SQL query can be simplified by combining the calculations and conditions into a single query with a `WITH` clause for better readability and performance.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
