The 'singer_in_concert' table is required to link singers to specific concerts, as it contains the 'Singer_ID' and 'concert_ID', allowing us to find out which concerts the singers performed in. Lastly, the 'concert' table is necessary because it includes the 'Year' column, which helps us determine the year of the concert and thus the age of the singers at the time of the song's release in 2001.
