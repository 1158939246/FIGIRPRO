The 'singer_in_concert' table is necessary to link the singers to specific concerts, which may provide context for the song's performance. Lastly, the 'concert' table is required to determine the year of the concert in which the song 'Gentleman' was performed, as it is implied that the song's release year is relevant to the concert year. Since the song 'Gentleman' was released in 2014, we need to ensure we are looking at the correct year and the corresponding ages of the singers at that time.
