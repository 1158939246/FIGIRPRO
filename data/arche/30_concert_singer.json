Divide and Conquer:**\n\n* **Main Question:** If the \"Week 2\" concert was held at Somerset Park stadium, what are the ID and name of each concert held at Somerset Park stadium, and what percentage of the singers in each concert held at Somerset Park stadium are female singers?\n    * **Analysis:** We need to find the concerts held at Somerset Park stadium and calculate the percentage of female singers for each concert. This requires joining the `concert`, `stadium`, and `singer_in_concert` tables.\n    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`)) AS `female_percentage` FROM `concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Stadium_ID` = `T2`.`Stadium_ID` INNER JOIN `singer_in_concert` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T3`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `singer` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Singer_ID` = `T4`.`Singer_ID` WHERE `T2`.`Name` = 'Somerset Park' GROUP BY `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`\n\n    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify concerts held at Somerset Park stadium\n        * **Analysis:** This is done by filtering the `stadium` table for the name 'Somerset Park' and joining it with the `concert` table.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`Name` = 'Somerset Park'\n\n    * **Sub-question 2:** Calculate the percentage of female singers\n        * **Analysis:** We will count the total number of singers and the number of female singers for each concert, then calculate the percentage.\n        * **Pseudo SQL:** (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`))\n\n**2. Assembling SQL:**\n\n* **Sub-question 1 (concerts held at Somerset Park):**\n    * **SQL:** `T2`.`Name` = 'Somerset Park'\n\n* **Sub-question 2 (percentage of female singers):**\n    * **SQL:** (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`))\n\n* **Main Question (concert ID, name, and female percentage):**\n    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`, (COUNT(CASE WHEN `T4`.`Is_male` = 'F' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(`T4`.`Singer_ID`)) AS `female_percentage` FROM `concert` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `stadium` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Stadium_ID` = `T2`.`Stadium_ID` INNER JOIN `singer_in_concert` AS `T3` ON `T1`.`concert_ID` = `T3`.`concert_ID` INNER JOIN `singer` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Singer_ID` = `T4`.`Singer_ID` WHERE `T2`.`Name` = 'Somerset Park' GROUP BY `T1`.`concert_ID`, `T1`.`concert_Name`\n\n**3. Simplification and Optimization:**\n\n* The SQL query from step 2 is already efficient, using `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables and calculating the percentage directly in the `SELECT` clause.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n"
